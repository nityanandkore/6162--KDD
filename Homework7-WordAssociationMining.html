/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<pre>[&#39;DENNIS SCHWARTZ &#34;Movie Reviews and Poetry&#34;\nUNMADE BEDS (director: Nicholas Barker; cast: Brenda Monte, Michael De Stephano, Aimee Copp, Mikey Russo, 1997)\nWhether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up, as the director stated it is, is unimportant; the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single New Yorkers exist for a period of nine months, featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves, concerned with getting older and still being single. Their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical. It is a film that highlights the problems that can be found in urban areas across America, as we bear witness to the plight of these singles trying to search for a mate through the internet and the personals, faced with agonizing loneliness and unresolved psychological problems. That these four are not particularly people that I can readily sympathize with, does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told, one that has many implications on our culture, relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world.\nThe result is an interesting and stylized docudrama, a &#34;Rear Window&#34; for singles. The film imitates those famous apartment windows Jimmy Stewart looked into for that 1950s look at New York City. This time it is not a crime that we see, but is a voyeurist\&#39;s delight, and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home, as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldn\&#39;t see. But it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film, which is really not a documentary, except in its style.\nBrenda Monte is Italian, she does not care for Jewish men and will not even consider dating them because she does not find them attractive, she is most proud of her big breasts, has a 20-year-old daughter from a previously failed marriage, and she tells us she receives no child support for her. This could be a personal ad about her, if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love(she can have sex whenever she wants to), but for monetary reasons. She wants to work out some deal with a guy where they come to some arrangement satisfactory to both of them, but she must get money for it, and it should be clear that she is not a prostitute. Her vulgar story is interspliced with the three other stories, but there is no connecting links to the others.\nMichael De Stephano is the nicest one of the four, except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals. It probably stems from his fear that people will think that he is queer because he is not married. He is a 40-year-old romantic, who is troubled that women find his diminuitive height to be a no-no for them. He wants a permanent relationship with marriage in mind. He is serious, stable, and straightforward, and sounds a lot like what women want in guy, but he says that is what they say they want, but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly, going after them just for the sex.\nAimee Copp has the most serious problems of the four, she is obese, depressive, has lost hope, suffers from a poor image of herself, and desperately wants to get married. She relates these feelings to her lifetime childhood friend Laurie, who happens to be skinny, and is not faced with the tormenting dating problems her 28-year-old friend is having.\nMikey Russo is a braggart, who backs up his claims that he only goes out with beauties by showing snapshots of some of his previous dates. He is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be. Though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him, especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt, which in his lingo, is an ugly dog, by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave. This 54-year-old failed screenwriter and current security director prides himself on being a gentleman, and makes no bones about the fact that he is a womanizer, and admits that he is his own worst enemy. All he wants in life is to take an attractive lady to bed.\nThis film might be upsetting to some, but it is a fresh look at an old problem, and its aim is readily accomplished, as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary.\nREVIEWED ON 2/17/99\n&#39;,
 &#39;A brilliant, witty mock documentary of Jean Seberg, that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of, but did not actually say, these are Mark Rappaport\&#39;s words. Proving once again, that she is being exploited, though in a benevolent way, by a film that rails against her exploitation. She was exploited by the director who discovered this 17-year-old in a nationwide star search for an unknown to play the juicy part in his SAINT JOAN, that is, the irrepressible Otto Preminger, the charming party guest, the publicity hound, and the tyrannical director for women; and her second husband, Romaine Gary, who poked fun at her political views and humiliated her in his films. There was also the brief affair with the future star, Clint Eastwood, which meant nothing to him and everything to her; and the F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover, spreading malicious rumors about her, falsely saying she was pregnant with a black child, trying everything possible to ruin her career and life.\nMary Beth Hurt is a perfect Jean Seberg, looking and sounding like her, exhibiting the easy way she talked, reflecting her small-town Midwestern Iowa roots. This journal (a journal that she never kept) takes us through her innocent years up to her suicide in 1979, when she was 40, and was resolved in the knowledge that she couldn\&#39;t be the somebody that she wasn\&#39;t.\nRappaport interestingly explores the early film life of Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda, who started out the same time she did and were roughly the same age, and were exploited as much as she was, but who survived to find their own identity and stardom. The difference between their success and her failure, he points out, is that these stars had a distinguished family name to see them through. This film is as much about them as it is about her, covering the film industry with the knowledge that, &#34;it is called showbiz,&#34; he says, &#34;not showart.&#34;\nHer involvement with the Black Panthers shows that her motivation was to be of help to the downtrodden, to get the kids a better education and food in their belly, thinking that maybe violence was some kind of answer to the poverty and injustice she saw in the black community. By this time, her life had taken a downward turn, she was heavily into drinking and taking drugs, her judgment was certainly questionable.\nPreminger, the egotist he was, answered the critics who panned her acting ability in Saint Joan, by giving her another starring part in one of his films, realizing that they did it with such glee, partly because they wanted him to fall on his face. But he wouldn\&#39;t admit he was wrong and immediately cast her in his next film, BONJOUR TRISTESSE. She played the younger woman, in love with an older man. This is the film that the French critic and soon to be New Wave cinema icon, Jean-Luc-Godard, saw her in, and took her to Paris to play in the critically acclaimed BREATHLESS. She was to appear in many films afterward, but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about, LILITH. Where she holds her own with such future stars and scene stealers as Peter Fonda and Warren Beatty.\nThis film challenges our credibility, it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times, telling us secrets that may or may not be true. It also enlightens us that Seberg\&#39;s stare into the camera was basically a no-no for an actor to do at that time, but is now acceptable, making her a trend setter. In the voice-over, he says that &#34;she felt the camera was stealing her soul.&#34; This is a clever film, immensely satisfying and enjoyable; and, fortunately, the director casts Jean in a favorable light, she seems to deserve that.\nREVIEWED ON 1/28/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;NOSTALGHIA (director: Andrei Tarkovsky; cast: Oleg Jankovsky (Andrei Gortchakov), Erland Josephson (Domenico), Domiziana Giordano (Eugenia), Patrizia Terreno (Gortchakov\&#39;s wife), Laura De Marchi (chambermaid), Delia Boccardo (Domenico\&#39;s wife), 1983-It.)\nTarkovsky in his book, SCULPTING IN TIME, mentions that he wanted to make a film about Russian nostalgia- &#34;about that state of mind peculiar to our nation which affects Russians who are far from their native land. I wanted the film to be about the fatal attachment of Russians to their national roots, an attachment which they will carry with them for their entire lives, regardless of where destiny may fling them. How could I have imagined as I was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life; that from now until the end of my days I would bear the painful malady within myself?&#34;\nFor that reason, seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself, and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited, it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works, an intriguing masterpiece, that is equal to, if not better than his other masterpieces, SOLARIS, ANDREI RUBLYOV, THE SACRIFICE, and MIRROR.\nThis is the tale, and it seems almost unreal and dreamlike at times, of a Russian poet (Oleg) who is on assignment in Italy\&#39;s Tuscany area, to write a book about an obscure 17th - century Russian composer, Sosnovsky, who studied music in Bologna. His landowner sent him there because he believed he was immensely talented. He was able to live in Italy for awhile composing, but he soon returned to Russia voluntarily to face enslavement as a serf, evidently feeling that he would rather be a slave in the country he loved, than a free man in a country he did not understand. Something must have gone wrong, because soon after his return he hung himself. How to understand that, is puzzling to Oleg, who is deeply plagued himself with family problems and deeply ensconced in a brooding type of meditation, definetly not Buddhist-like, that leaves him in a state of disorientation as he tries to discover who he is.\nThe film opens in a deep fog, as he and his Rubenesque Italian translator (Giordano) drive in the sloping mountaneous terrain to visit one of the shrine\&#39;s that mostly women tourists visit when they pray here to the Virgin Mary. This opening scene is shot in black- and- white until the translator enters the church, and then it is shot in a magnificent sepia and pastel coloring. The visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the Virgin\&#39;s body are, indeed, startling. Tarkovsky will use the black- and- white shots again in the film when he is using flashbacks to show that he is dreaming or reflecting back on the events in his life.\nThe first impression one gets, is that he is having an affair with his translator, but that is not the case, he is so obsessed with his thoughts that he has difficulty communicating with her, which is frustrating for her, as she expects something to happen between them and, when nothing happens, blames it on her poor luck of always choosing the wrong man. The mood of the film is gloomy, when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope. The feeling one gets, is somewhat as if a child, saddened by the outside world, is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up, and thereby feels good about himself.When Giordano is asked by the sacristan, &#34;Whether she has come to pray to have a child, or to not have one,&#34; she says, &#34;She is just looking.&#34; The sacristan\&#39;s response is, &#34;What are you here for, then?&#34; The implication being that a woman\&#39;s duty is to raise kids. But what is even eerier than her evasive response, is that Oleg, who insisted on coming here, chooses not to even go inside the church. It would seem that he is making a statement to the effect, that he suddenly realizes, amidst such a religious setting, that what he wants to find is not outside of himself, that he cannot be a tourist anymore, he must look inside himself to find what he is looking for.\nHe meets his kindred spirit in a madman, a former math teacher(Erland), with gloom and doom prophesies for the world, who locks his family in the house for seven years for their own safety before someone breaks the door down and they escape; and, as one guest in the luxurious hotel Oleg is staying at says, &#34;the child runs out of there like a rat from his cage.&#34; These two hit it off, they see something in each other that is akin in spirit. At first, Erland is reluctant to talk about what he did, but when Oleg pursues him to his house, which is damaged and flooded from a leaky roof, their conversation becomes surreal, as both recognize in each other that they are possessed to do what it is they seem compelled to do and nothing can stop them.When Erland gives a prophetic speech in Rome and then torches himself to death to the accompaniment of music as his parishoners stand impassively by, and only his dog shows feelings for what is happening to him, we are struck with feelings of empathy and wonder about someone who is so sensitive, yet is not sensitive enough to function in a world that is so apathetic to the sufferings in others. His suicide is a harsh opinion on orthodox religion\&#39;s failing role in getting him to alleviate that suffering, and how it is quite necessary that we learn ourselves, how to humble ourself before we relate to God, otherwise there can be no proper cure for our disease.\nThe best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman. The poet is inarticulate, taken aback by his memories and loss of spirit. All the other people he meets on this journey, he forms only an allegorical relationship with, whether it\&#39;s the translator, or churchmen, or hotel guests, or the Italian workers, they all have little to say to him. The people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature, but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn, they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend. For Tarkovsky, this film is a lifetime journey, made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is, because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him. He must also be prepared to take care of his spiritual obligations. Since Tarkovsky, for all intensive purposes, is a projection, at least for this film, of Oleg, as he envisions his life passing before him, and is in anguish as he sees his faith being tested; and, as he starts to take hold of his fragile life, maybe for the first time in his long life, he seems like a changed person, who recognizes his melancholy to be a death wish, something that poetically inspires him, something that is necessary.\nThings do not seem so foreign to him, anymore. He knows now that he can travel anywhere in the world without a translator, as he lights the candles in the holy water at the hotel and carries out the promise he made to Erland when they conversed in his house. The flames are important reminders to him about what he must do to cleanse himself, as he takes the lit candles over the baths in his cupped hands; he believes they can burn away the core of the material world and give him hope for purity and an eternal life. The film ends in light, as through the open circular window of a ruined church the sun shines in and, metaphorically Erland\&#39;s house is transposed in it, symbolizing his divided state. And, as Oleg begins to meditatively see who he is inside these literary structures, he realizes that he is whole again, and that he will return to his native Russia that he loves so dearly, that is inside his blood; and he knows for certain, now, that it will be there for him, forever, wherever he goes.\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;PAYBACK (director: Brian Helgeland; cast:(Porter) Mel Gibson, (Val) Gregg Henry, (Rosie) Maria Bello, (Stegman) David Paymer,(Lynn) Deborah Kara Unger, (Carter) William Devane, (Bronson) Kris Kristofferson, (Mr. Fairfax) James Coburn, (Crooked Cop) Bill Duke, 1999)\nWhat we have, is a very cleverly done film, that is in it for the box-office and as an entertainment only film, and it should accomplish both aims, at least, entertainment wise, it is first-rate. It is a good mindless, violent flick for Americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened, such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our Prez and his lady intern (and, you know how serious that stuff was).\nTo get into the spirit of the film, you must suspend your belief in logic and accept this as a hero fantasy story, with the hero being a tainted one, basically fighting for his own pride and perverted sense of ethics, as he figures his life is worth $70, 000, that being the figure he is owed by his partner in crime, Val (Gregg), a sado-masochist, with no redeeming human qualities, who along with Porter (Mel), has robbed an Oriental crime family to get the unsavory dough, before he double-crossed Porter, and supposedly had him killed. But do remember, the bad hero, is not all that bad, he is Mel, the charming hero of countless adventure films, a guy who is full of good looks and charm, someone audiences love to like, and will plunk down their money to see his films in huge numbers. He also does the voice-over ala noir style, in a deep laconic voice, you know, like a Sam Spade would do it. The voice-over reassured me that he will live through the film (that\&#39;s good, because knowing him, he will be in every scene of this flick, and therefore I\&#39;m assured that I will be getting my money\&#39;s worth of Mel. You see, I don\&#39;t really care what happens to his character in this flick, per se, since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the cartoons. What I care about is being entertained, by golly, golly, golly, gee !).\nPAYBACK rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks, (or maybe, in a certain sense, pays it homage!!!) and does it with pizzazz. The big city it chooses for its locale is Chicago, with its tall buildings and el trains, adding a dark shade to its story. The only thing it fails to pick up from those great b/w films mood pieces of edginess from the 40s and 50s, is that their heroes were really underdogs, they were fighting the system, not out for their own ends and vanity only. This little difference is easy to ignore, but it is bothersome when I see how close Mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film. But I\&#39;m glad to report, ever so close, but no cigar, tough guy. You just can\&#39;t imitate that secret ingredient without being into the real thing. So take your $70, 000 clams you will extract from &#34;the outfit&#34;, and enjoy that money with the reformed whore with a heart of mush, Rosie (Maria), you both deserve it. You were both great to look at on screen, you played your hands well, and most importantly, I enjoyed the film, it had a lightness to it that made it very appealing.\nNeedless to say, there was not much to the plot for this stylish film, but for those of you who want to know the story line, this is a pure revenge film. Porter after being set-up by his junkie wife Lynn (Deborah), and Val, who needs a $130, 000 to square things with the &#34;outfit&#34; and get back into the organization, where he can really get good money and protection from the mob...The action scenes of this heist are super. Porter notices that the gang is not wearing their seat belts, so on their rounds, when they are carrying the loot, he crashes head-on to them, killing them and then robbing them of the loot. Then Val does his double-cross, as Porter\&#39;s wife shoots her hubby, taking all the money, which happens to be $140, 000. That is why our hero insists on only getting $70, 000 back, the sum he believes he is ethically owed for the work he did. This gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have been just a pointless actioner. At least, the filmmakers are having fun with this one, and it shows.\nFor the remainder of this slick film, Porter is either getting beat up or doing the beatings himself. In between there are assorted killings the traditional way, with a heater. But there is also a car full of mobsters getting blown up and some get blown up via the phone. There is plenty of action, so don\&#39;t worry you don\&#39;t have to think of anything when you are watching this flick, everything moves at break-neck speed. A duo of corrupt cops get into the act, one black the other white, very political correct, I must say. These filmmakers have a great eye for detail. And there is a sleaze ball drug dealer (Paymer), the one who sells bad heroin to Porter\&#39;s dear wife. He turns out to be the man Porter uses to contact Val upon his return from the dead. Then there is the Oriental gang, and their interest turns to Porter when they are tipped off that he robbed them. So, all-in-all, you have a lot of good action scenes going down, a lot of funny one-liners (I laughed out loud when Porter said, if I was any dumber I would have become a cop. You see, Porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses, Kristofferson, Coburn, and Devane). I, especially, liked seeing Devane, he is a throwback to the old noir foils. There is also an homage scene or a rip off, which ever you prefer, it doesn\&#39;t matter to me, when Porter rips the earring off a drug dealer\&#39;s ear, taking a chunk of his ear with it. You can\&#39;t help remembering Roman Polansky did that in CHINATOWN, a true modern noir film, a film that caught the essence of that genre.\nThe filmmakers are first time director and former screen writer of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, Brian Helgeland. The film is based on a novel, THE HUNTER, by Richard Stark. The film works for all the above reasons, and most of all it works, because Mel is great for the part.\nREVIEWED ON 3/7/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;WAKING NED DEVINE (director: Kirk Jones (III); cast: Ian Bannen (Jackie O&#39;Shea), David Kelly (I) (Michael O&#39;Sullivan), Fionnula Flanagan (Annie O&#39;Shea), Susan Lynch ( Maggie), James Nesbitt (Pig Finn), Maura O&#39;Malley (Mrs. Kennedy), James Ryland (Dennis Fitzgerald), Robert Hickey (Maurice), Jimmy Keogh (Ned Devine), Paddy Ward (Brendy), Eileen Dromey (Lizzy Quinn), Dermot Kerrigan (Father Patrick), Kitty Fitzgerald (Kitty), Brendan F. Dempsey (Lotto Official), 1998-Ireland)\nAnother feel good type foreign movie, ala THE FULL MONTY, that seems to please the audience, drawing in enough crowds to turn a nifty profit for its independent producers, and is good enough so that the critics are very generous in their praises, playing down the film&#39;s bland politics.\nA quaint Irish village, replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics, a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road, a bunch of likable locals, colorful scenery, wonderful Irish pipes heard in the background, and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film, with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it. Though the name Devine is pretty close to divine, the subject of religion is dealt with in a lighter manner, as the visiting priest (Dermot) tells the young boy (Hickey), that he works for Jesus, and the kid retorts, that he wouldn&#39;t work for anyone who doesn&#39;t pay him or for someone he never met.\nThe only serious flaw in the film, is a contrived phone booth scene towards the end of the movie. That scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised, by getting rid of the fly in the ointment, the one character in the village that upset its tranquility. The strength in the film lies in the great acting job accomplished by the townfolks, especially Ian Bannen (Jackie O&#39;Shea), David Kelly (Michael O&#39;Sullivan), and Fionnula Flanagan (Annie O&#39;Shea). They gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated.\nSomeone in this small village of 52 people (Tullymore) is reported as the winner of the Irish lottery, worth close to 7 million pounds. But when no one claims it, Jackie becomes suspicious of who that could be. He discovers it is the elderly loner, Ned Devine, who has dropped dead from shock, still clutching the ticket in his hand when Jackie visits his house. So he recruits the help of his dear friend Michael to act as the dead Ned Devine, so that they can fool the lottery people and collect the winnings. Michael is a genuine character, who steals the picture with a classic comical motorcycle ride in the nude, as he races down some backroads to beat the lottery man (Brendan) to Ned Devine&#39;s house. But they soon realize that they will have to tell the rest of the town their plan in order for this to work. They get everyone in town in line, but for one nasty old woman (Dromey), who is deemed the town&#39;s witch, to agree that they will split the money equally, and they will swear to the lottery people that Michael is Ned.\nLife in the village goes on in its routine way, and we get to see some of the jealousies that exist in town, the class differences, and how quiet and set in its ways the townfolks really are. And, of course, there is a wee bit of gossip in the air. Maggie (Lynch) has a young boy and no husband. She has a few suitors, but has not told them who is the child&#39;s father. The suitor she is most interested in, is Pig Finn (Nesbitt), but she will not marry the hard working lad because he smells like his pigs.\nThe twist in the story is interesting, and if you have not seen the film and do not want to know this twist, please skip the following paragraph and go directly to my grade rating of the movie.\nWell, the kid&#39;s father turns out to be none other than Ned Devine. By right, Maggie could have claimed all of the lottery winnings, but decides it is better that the kid have someone he can call a father who will raise him, than all the money from the lottery ticket. Besides, her share of the winnings would suit her fine. So she agrees to marry Pig, and he promises to give up raising pigs. Now tell me, how many films have you seen lately that can get away with such a corny but happy ending and still be critically well-thought of ?\nREVIEW ON 2/27/99\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;HAPPINESS (director: Todd Solondz; cast: Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Cynthia Stevenson, Lara Flynn Boyle, Jared Harris, Rufus Read, Ben Gazzara, Louise Lasser, Camryn Manheim, 1998)\nHAPPINESS is not a film about happiness, because happiness is not real but imagined, therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state. So goes the theme of this dark comedy, meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with, in a film that features a pedophile rapist (Dylan), a murderer (Camyrn), an obscene caller (Hoffman), a masturbator (Read), a Russian immigrant thief (Jared), and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos, as Solondz\&#39;s morbid sense of humor turns to New Jersey\&#39;s suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race.\nThis is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it (Solondz refused the studio\&#39;s offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as, William Hurt, because he felt Dylan was just right for the role). This film is meant for an art house type of audience, one that is able, as difficult as it may be, to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen. I would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it, that would just defeat its purpose. The audience I saw this film with, were mostly Williams College students and faculty, and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it, where Solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and, in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story, he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters. The laughter was appropriate, and even &#34;hip,&#34; as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies, and it didn\&#39;t seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked, causing people to react as a group rather than individually. I found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent; and, there was at no time just one person alone laughing (but, the best part, is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed).\nHAPPINESS is a difficult picture to watch, there are no good guys or gals. In order for it to work as a complete film, one has to accept the interrelated tales of three different types of sisters and their relationship with their miserable parents, Gazzara and Lasser, (who don\&#39;t love each other and are not happy whatever they do; he has given up on everything, including getting a divorce; and, she feels a need to cling to this loveless marriage, no matter what).\nThe sisters all suffer from ego-centredness, and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has, as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves.\nJane Adams plays Joy, who is anything but joyous, as she cries through most of the film, having no luck at finding the right job or man. Trish (Cynthia) is the oldest and seemingly the most content, parroting all the facile virtues of middle America, living out the American dream with her three wonderful kids and successful psychologist husband (Dylan), who is gentle and understanding, but hides from her the fact that he is a pervert and a pedophile. It is also interesting to note in the analysis he undergoes, that he only tells his analyst the dreams he wants to tell, seemingly to satisfy the analyst and not damage his career, while he neglects to tell the analyst his true sexual feelings. Solondz closes the door for any of his characters to get the help they need.\nLara Flynn Boyle plays Helen, the successful author who can\&#39;t stand who she is, who is so full of herself, constantly harping to her sisters how she has been with so many good looking men and is never lonely but complains that she just has too much to do. She is, also, materially very well-off; and, condescending to her sisters.This illusion of her good life is shattered when an obscene caller, a nerdy computer guy, Hoffman, turns her on with one of his calls and she makes a date with him, even after he hangs up on her, but he is apparently afraid of her too willing response to his proposition, so their relationship fizzles out. By chance, he is also undergoing analysis with our shrink, Dylan, so you know what kind of help he is getting for his problems.\nThe most poignant and unflinching scenes in the film are between the accused pedophile father and his son (Read), as Dylan, who is superb in his role, honestly counsels his 11-year-old son about masturbation, and later on, has the difficult task of telling his son that he drugged and raped his son\&#39;s friend and then raped one of his other friends and would do it again because he can\&#39;t control himself. I could understand people being upset with this character, as this character is given a forum to tell us what he is about, and as difficult as it is to feel anything but contempt for him, we at least see what this type of person looks like up close and we can ascertain that he is human, no other film, to my knowledge, has done this so thoroughly, and has done it so humanely and perceptively, in fact, very few films would have enough balls to touch this subject; Lang\&#39;s M, with Peter Lorre, does to a certain degree, but Lang\&#39;s film was different in nature, and just touched bases with the peripheral nature of the problem, he never pushed it to the front of the film and into the face of the audience; his was mostly a noir crime story, while Solondz\&#39;s film centers on exploring one\&#39;s disturbing emotional states.\nThis is a very solid film, that is well-acted, that is understandably not for everyone, yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu, and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line, this is still a powerful film, one deserving of attention and intelligent critique, one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art, even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told. Many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films.That is not the case with this film, obviously.This film leaves you little choice, you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is, or you can ignore it, or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for, and therefore come to hate it. I came close to loving it, while not exactly loving it, mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages. But close to loving it, means I liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character. I did, however, think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them.\nREVIEWED ON 11/17/98\nDennis Schwartz: Movie Reviews ozus @sover.net\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;LEON MORIN, PRIEST (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Jean-Paul Belmondo (Leon Morin), Emmanuelle Riva (Barny), Irene Tunc (Christine Sangredin), Nicole Mirel (Sabine Levy), Marco Behar (Edelman), 1961-Fr.)\nHow many other directors could handle with great deftness the innuendoes of this potentially, sexually explosive relationship between an attractive and problematic widow with a young daughter (Emmanuelle) and a handsome 26-year-old priest (Belmondo), during the German Occupation of a small French town ? Melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner. I suspect, not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life... Melville&#39;s sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late 40s, and that list would include the great director, Bresson, who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as Melville, who at times outdoes Melville&#39;s Melville, giving some the false impression that Melville imitated Bresson.\nMelville&#39;s success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent, and allowing it to be emotionally compelling. His characterization of the Occupation and how some survived it by becoming collaborators with the Germans, or by becoming part of the black market, or by becoming part of the Resistance Movement, is accomplished by relating the priest to all that goes on in town, and how the priest brings out his ideas of what God is and how tolerance is the message of all sane people, even as the horrors of what the Nazis stand for is glossed over in the background, its evil is still felt by those who must live under them; meanwhile, Melville is connecting the religious needs of the community and the deportation of the Jews, with the personal savior, Jesus Christ, who he reminds us, died as a Jew. The implication being, for those who think that because they are Christians, they don&#39;t have to be concerned about what is happening to the Jews, are sorely mistaken, because they have forgotten who Christ is and how he died for everyone and how if he was around today, he would be a Jew taken away to the death camps. The priest sees his task in life as a fulfillment of his Christian vows by helping those who need to be helped, no matter what they believe in. He appeals especially to the women in town, as a sort of modern day Christ, that results in some very complex emotional questions being raised, relating to mundane matters and affairs of the heart and spiritual quests.\nBelmondo&#39;s performance as a priest who questions authority and is not afraid of what others might think is superb, as he attracts many women practitioners, especially, leaving himself vulnerable to public opinion when he openly maintains a very close relationship with the widow. His argument for a God couldn&#39;t be put forth with more verve and intelligence, even though it didn&#39;t convince me, as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion, nevertheless, this film moved me to further expand what I think... It even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church, something that I have rarely come across outside the cinema.\nREVIEWED ON 2/12/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#34;LES BICHES (THE DOES)(director: Claude Chabrol; cast: Jean-Louis Trintignant (Paul Thomas), Jacqueline Sassard (Why), Stéphane Audran (Frédérique), Henri Attal (Robèque), Dominique Zardi (Riais), 1968-France)\nThis is top notch filmmaking by a director who when he is on the mark is as good as anyone in the business. Stéphane Audran is Frédérique, a wealthy woman with lesbian leanings, who on a whim, picks up a young attractive, impoverished Parisian sidewalk artist, with the unusual name of Why (Sassard). She takes her to her other home in St. Tropez and introduces her to how the wealthy live. What complicates their relationship even further, is the arrival of Paul (Trintignant), a handsome and talented architect, who immediately makes love with Why, but soon finds he has more in common with Frédérique, so the two of them become lovers. Paul shows a keen interest in having a bisexual menage-a-trois, but Frédérique is determined to keep him for herself.\nThe film is divided into a number of segments that ask questions about the lead characters, questions they cannot readily ask about themselves.\nThat Chabrol has the audacity to weave a story around these three diverse characters, each searching for something inside them that remains a mystery to them, plays well against the unmitigated sexual yearnings and need to experience sex these three have in common. It is a way to look at the 1960s, that is through the lenses of these materialists, who seemed to shun that period&#39;s more typical cultural revolution. The women&#39;s search is a personal one, it is for some kind of comfort that can take away their loneliness. By all indications, they could care less about art or the world. Why knows she is not a good artist, and Frédérique could care less. Paul&#39;s search remains more of a mystery, as his only other interest besides these two women, is the love he has for his work.\nThough the sex is not explicit, its tenseness is what is felt as an obsession, as Frédérique and Paul feel a happiness in their love that fills a void in their life that they couldn&#39;t find before. Why is the odd one out, but can&#39;t accept her fate, as she begins to transform, changing her look and style, so that she could become a clone for Frédérique. Once she has tasted this lifestyle, she can&#39;t go back to being a virgin sidewalk artist again. Paul, being the most intuitive of the three, senses a danger in the house, which also has two gay (Robèque and Riais) freeloading sychophants there, who are nasty sorts, having outlived their usefulness to Frédérique, and are asked by her, unceremoniously, to leave.\nWhat makes this one of Chabrol&#39;s better films, is the unexpected resources of the characters to pull off this emotionally draining story: the females, the very fragile does of the film, and the male, who is the hunter, wrestle with the ambiguities of their sexual intentions and inclinations, as it leads up to the tragic ending.Their emotionally desperate situation always seems to be one step beyond their reach, as they get deeper and deeper into an unresolvable situation, with the film ending on its bleakest note, with a certain amount of vagueness still remaining, that is befitting a film that has told its story with all the style and clarity it could muster.\nREVIEWED ON 3/2/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\nDennis Schwartz: Movie Reviews ozus @sover.net\n&#34;,
 &#34;FUNNY GAMES ( director: Michael Haneke; cast: Susanne Lothar (Anna), Ulrich Muhe (Georg), Arno Frisch (Paul), Frank Giering (Peter), Stefan Clapczynski (Georg jr.), 1997-Austria)\nA cold thriller, exploring the exploitation of violence by heaping up a huge quantity of exploitive violence itself to make some points about what is the public&#39;s attitude and tolerance level for the random violence that is present in society. In other words, this is an exploitive violent film railing against exploitive violent films, if that makes sense. It holds to the so-called philosophy, of fighting fire with fire. By crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore, much of this is done off-screen, which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem, the director is able to keep the film arty. But, by playing with the public&#39;s prurient interest in violence as a way of life, something they have been numbed into accepting as part of their television and MTV inheritance, this powerful story has a chilling affect on rationality, questioning the viewing habits and the responses to violence the public has.\nThis film is about a wealthy, well-educated couple, Georg and Anna (Ulrich and Suzanne) and their young son, Georg jr. (Stefan), going to their isolated luxurious, lakeside summer resort home, to do some boating, golfing and escape from the summer heat. A polite, clean-cut intruder, Peter (Frank), comes in to borrow eggs from them for their neighbor and won&#39;t leave, turning rude, as his partner, also clean-cut, Paul (Arno), soon arrives to torment the couple, smacking Georg&#39;s knee with a golf club so that he is disabled for the remainder of this hostage situation and is unable to properly defend his family. There is also the most riveting scene in the movie, where Anna is forced to strip, subject to possible rape, while her son is blindfolded and her husband is forced to answer ridiculous questions. The hostage situation is barely watchable, the mental torture the couple is put through is sickening, these psychologically sadistic murderers offer no true explanation for their actions, using mockery and cynical responses to mask the power trip they are on. They have no redeeming human features, and their cruel intent is played up for the camera&#39;s benefit, Paul even winks at the camera, as if the audience is in on this game they are playing. In one of the scenes, the camera is rewound when the audience is given the gratuitous pleasure in seeing one of the sadists killed, but even this is not granted to the audience when the scene is finally rewound.\nWhat remains to be comprehended, is how a family trying to survive and hold onto to their dignity, can manage in the best way they can, as these misfits play games with them, pretending to give them choices in choosing their suffering, but always telling them that they will kill them before they leave. These thugs are complete fakes, even their names are fictitious, as they keep referring to themselves with different names, such as Tom and Jerry, Beavis and Butt-head. Paul calls Peter Fatty several times to the mock displeasure of Peter, Tom, Beavis, or whoever this obese, snide monster really is. Everything about these two is a facade, their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up, their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed, realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film, despite the director&#39;s aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation, to reduce everyone to a cartoon image, to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life. That part doesn&#39;t work as well as the director might think it does. The family is real to the audience. Georg&#39;s lack of courage and quiet in the face of danger, leaves him distraught, unable to face himself. Anna&#39;s resolute behavior and her human foibles make us sympathize with her, even more so, even if we are not particularly enamored by the way she deports herself when she is in control of things; and the son&#39;s confusion touches us deeply, as we see him look for direction to his now helpless parents, a nightmare for any parent, to be in a situation where you can&#39;t protect your child.\nI am left with the choice of how to rate the movie, knowing full well that the sophist argument is, if you don&#39;t like what you are seeing, then don&#39;t see the rest of it. That&#39;s well and good. And if that is your philosophy on how to how to handle exploitive material, I can&#39;t condemn you for it. I would think that many people of sound mind would feel this way and will walk out of the theater. But I don&#39;t think, as the director thinks, in an interview he gave, that people who stay to see the entire movie, really need the movie. I don&#39;t, necessarily, need this movie. I stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out, and I was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art, it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently. The film is successful not because of its message, but because it is a well-crafted film, from a filmmaker who knows how to make films, even if he pretends to be doing more than he is capable of. This film succeeds with the small share of the audience it can garner, because it is, surprisingly enough, an entertaining film, and it broaches a subject that is very difficult to understand, that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is anything new to say about violence. And the hope is, that we might be able to understand violence a little bit better, even if, it has to come to us by way of an unorthodox position; and, that maybe, since violent films are so universally popular, we can somehow see the human condition on film and not be anesthetized by the reality of violence.\nAs far as the critical success of this film goes, I think it is merely a better version of all those Halloween grizzly killing pictures we are subjected to--- if you want, a high class TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE film.\nREVIEWED ON 1/30/99\nDennis Schwartz: Movie Reviews ozus @sover.net\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#34;MEN WITH GUNS (director: John Sayles; cast: Federico Luppi, Dan Rivera Gonzalez, Damian Delgado, Tania Cruz, Damian Alcazar, Mandy Patinkin, Kathryn Grody, 1998 Mexico)\nThe world is a hard place, is the theme that runs through Sayles&#39; well thought-out, political film about a capable upper-class, but naive doctor from the city of some hypothetical Latin American country. The part of the doctor is played by the distinguished looking, white-haired Argentinean, Luppi. The doctor has trained some students to be doctors in the remote mountainous areas where the Indians live, under the auspicies of a specially funded program. He hasn&#39;t heard from them since they left, and is now anxious to visit them on his vacation and see how they are doing before he retires. He takes his fancy 4-wheeler and makes the difficult trek to this impoverished region in order to see what his legacy will be. He is concerned about leaving a legacy before he dies. He is filled with pride about his accomplishments, but this pride turns to agony as he slowly realizes that all the doctors he has trained have been assassinated and that he has sent them to their deaths by not preparing them for the realities of their job.\nOn his journey to find the political truth, the doctor picks up some travelling companions, who in turn add their tales of woe to the horrors of living in such a bad political climate. From the orphan boy (Dan), he meets in the starving Indian village, he learns how little the people have, how ruthless both the army (which is made up of mostly Indian soldiers) and the guerillas are. These are the men with guns, they will kill anyone, whether they have a reason to or not. The white plantation owners are the exploiters of the people, keeping them working at unreasonably low wages.\nThe boy turns out to be useful to the doctor because he speaks the native language and he knows how to find his way in spots where there are no visible roads. The army deserter (Delgado), robs the doctor and then kidnaps him, and through the use of flashbacks we see how he participated as a medic in the army in violence and murder of the villagers.\nA priest hitches a ride and tells his story of losing faith while working with the villagers, and no longer considers himself a priest. He does not see what good religion can do in such a repressive area, as the doctor questions him and states that a person must believe in something.\nAnd finally a mute young lady, who has been raped by the soldiers and subsequently has stopped speaking, comes along with them hoping to find a secure place to live.\nA talkative American couple (Mandy and Kathryn), interested in the ancient civilization of this country, but unable to comprehend what is going down for the current Indians living here, strike a chord for all those who should see what is taking place but can&#39;t, and this is because they can&#39;t face what is right in front of them; but, because they are living charmed lives, they will return to their country unscathed by all the atrocities around them.\nThe doctor is the eyes and ears for what is going on. His slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this non-didactic, straight forward ambitious project of Sayles. He does not glorify the Indians, the ones who are the most cruelly treated. He shows how unopen and hostile they can be to visitors, and how when given a chance to get a better life they will do anything to escape, even kill their own people. The strength that comes from such a story, is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented. The problem with all this, is that since no specific country was named, it must mean that Sayles considers this to be a universal problem, and that makes the problem gigantic, with no one to be specifically blamed, especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages, it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings. The other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated, that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone, that governments have to be held accountable for their actions, and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing, even if, most of all, people have to learn how to help themselves.\nThis is a very strong, independent minded picture, that chooses to tell a very difficult story, one that not many people will take comfort in. But the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world. It seems that this film might have some influence, but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do, as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help.\nREVIEWED ON 10/6/98\nDennis Schwartz: Movie Reviews ozus @sover.net\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ ©\n&#34;,
 &#39;WHITE BALLOON, THE (director: Jafar Panahi; cast: Aida Mohammadkhani, Moshen Kalifi, Fereshteh Sadr Orfani, Anna Bourkowska, Aliasghar Samadi, Mohammad Shahani, Mohammad Bahktiari, 1995-Iran)\nThis is a simple, childlike, non-political Iranian, neo-realism film, told from the vantage point of a 7-year-old girl (Aida), who desires a fat goldfish in the shop, which costs 100 tomans, instead of the skinny ones she has at home, for the New Year celebration, which comes on the first day of spring. Goldfish, for the Iranian celebrants, are symbols of life.\nWhat is truly amazing about this masterly done film, is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the New Year, that is marked off by repeated radio reminders. Meanwhile, a small radius of Tehran that is familiar to the girl but not really known to her, is seen through her wide-open eyes as she walks home from shopping with her mother (Sadr). She is constantly watched by her mother, but is childishly curious about the shops and the group of men who hang-out around the snake charmers, a place she is forbidden to go to. When they arrive home, we are not invited inside their home, as if we were intruders, but we see their courtyard, and we get a pretty good idea how this middle-class family lives.\nHer mother is upset with her because she did not follow her closely while shopping and because she can\&#39;t stop talking and whining about the chubby goldfish she wants to buy, begging her to give her the money to buy the goldfish. At home, we meet her older brother (Mohsen), who returns from an errand for his father, who is not seen because he is showering, but we hear him get angry at Moshen for bringing him soap instead of shampoo.\nThe brother thinks she is crazy to want the goldfish, he tells her, &#34;You can see two movies for that amount of money.&#34; But she is not dissuaded and manages to bribe her brother by giving him her blue balloon, and he talks his mother into giving him a 500- toman note to purchase the fish, if he brings back the change. When he returns with the banknote, he is surprised as Aida grabs the money and rushes out to purchase the fish, going against her mother\&#39;s wishes to be out alone in the streets of Tehran.\nShe re-meets the snake charmers, and her curiousity can\&#39;t resist watching them. They cheat her out of her money, but she manages to get the money back from them. By this time, we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl, it is not unlike our Christmas time desire to please our children with gifts, whether or not the gifts are worth it or not, they have an intrinsic value above their real worth, and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts. The brilliance of the film, is that the story that unfolds is about the little girl\&#39;s adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does, and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story; it is something that is universally understood, that we forget that we are talking about Iran, the country that we demonized, our arch enemy; and, if the film can be criticized, it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not. Though, I think, that might be unfair to say, since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons.\nShe, once again, loses the banknote, it falls down a street grating and she can\&#39;t get it out. Thusly, we meet a tailor, who is arguing with a customer, and from the girl\&#39;s anxious eyes we see how gigantic and aloof adults can be to a child, especially when she can\&#39;t wait to tell him about the lost money that fell down the grating, but he doesn\&#39;t listen to her. It is interesting to see how different he can be when another adult, an older woman, talks to the tailor in behalf of the little girl.\nThe remainder of the film is about her attempt to recover the money, with her brother, now, by her side.\nFinally, an Afghan balloon seller is recruited to help recover the banknote. He helps them accomplish the task, but when this is done, the girl and her brother run off gleefully to their home to celebrate the New Year, and the busy street starts to empty out as everyone is rushing home. The final shot, as the film ends, is of the Afghan boy, smiling just seconds ago, now saddened, alone with just one white balloon that he did not sell, and we realize that this film ends with our impression of him on our minds, and the little girl\&#39;s adventure seems to be just one little story told; and, now, we can easily forget about her, but the Afghan\&#39;s plight, his loneliness remains etched in our mind, as it affects the sensiblities we have about family life and makes us reflect what it is to be a foreigner in a country where family life is so cherished, and it leaves us thinking not about any of the celebrants, but about what is going to happen to him, how will he celebrate the New Year! This is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air, that is not contrived or pretentious, but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film, topping off a very human film, that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern Iran.\nTHE WHITE BALLOON is a masterpiece in its simplicity, and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved; and, how childhood is explored, pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity, are unmatched in most Hollywood films. If I had to compare it to any film that I have seen, I think of De Sica\&#39;s THE BICYCLE THIEF and see some of the same values about life in both films.\nREVIEWED ON 11/19/98\nDennis Schwartz: Movie Reviews ozus @sover.net\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;PEEPING TOM (director: Michael Powell; cast: Carl Boehm (Mark), Moira Shearer (stand-in murder victim), Anna Massey (Anna), 1960-GB)\nCan you imagine that this innovative, creative film, a groundbreaker for its time, managed to virtually end the career of its great and noted director, as the subject&#39;s sexual content was too much to take for so many of the self-righteous critics of that time! This is a film about Scoptophilia (voyeurism): the morbid urge to gaze, or as it is more commonly called, being a peeping Tom.\nMark Lewis (Carl) is a cameraman with a great psychological problem, he is fixated on taking pictures of females, bringing on a fear in them by pointing a spear at them, then having them watch themselves in a mirror as he kills them. His father was a scientist, who experimented with Mark when he was young, by filming him constantly, shining lights in his eyes to wake him from sleep, throwing lizards in his bed, and always testing his young son to see how he reacts to fear. When Mark&#39;s mother dies, the father (Michael Powell plays this part in the home movies shown) quickly remarries, upsetting the youngster, even further. He gives Mark a camera as a gift, and this starts Mark&#39;s obsession with voyeurism.\nWhen his father dies, Mark inherits the house, which he rents out to an assortment of tenants. Coming home one evening, a 21st birthday party is being given for one of the tenants, Helen (Anna), who is strangely attracted to this very shy, awkward man, who she doesn&#39;t realize is the landlord. She visits him in his apartment and he takes her into his darkroom and shows her his ghastly home movies. And, even though, he acts very peculiar, she remains interested in him, and he shows that he likes her and will not harm her.\nMeanwhile there is a murder that occurs in the same style as the previous one reported in the newspapera, where the victim has died with a dreaded look of fear, this one takes place in the film studio where he works as a focuser, which brings in the police to investigate. On his other job, where he works for a newstand dealer, he takes pictures of models who pose for him in sexually alluring ways. He murders one of the models knowing full well that the police are tailing him. He even films the police as they are closing in to catch him. He says that this is all part of the documentary he is shooting.\nMark Lewis is this pathetically gentle psychopath, who has a compulsion to kill, brought on by his early childhood years, who cannot even be saved by love, as his compulsion to kill and die is stronger than anything else. This fascinating film is as intensely good as any thriller done by Hitchcock or Chabrol. Its intensity and compelling characterization of Mark, is a landmark in films.\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;HILARY AND JACKIE (director: Anand Tucker; cast: Emily Watson (Jacqueline du Pré), Rachel Griffiths (Hilary), David Morrissey (Kiffer Finzi), James Fraim (Daniel Barenboim), Charles Dance (father), Celia Imrie (mother), Keely Flanders and Auriol Evans (the du Pre sisters as youngsters), 1998)\nThis intelligent and emotionally moving film, is based on the true-life story, as recorded in the autobiography, &#34;A Genius in the Family,&#34; written by one of the musical prodigy English sisters, Hilary (Rachel), the flautist in the Du Pre family. Jackie (Emily) is the younger sister, the one who reaches fame as a virtuoso cellist, especially known for her interpretations of Elgar\&#39;s compositions. The crux of the film is about their sisterly relationship, their competition with each other and their need for each other, as they were growing up in the 1950s. The differences between them, that eventually has them living disparate lives, becomes the dramatic focal point of the film, with Jackie growing up to become the great musician who marries another celebrated musician, Daniel Barenboim (James), but who is very unhappy for reasons that are very complex and not easily answered but thoroughly explored in the film, leaving the audience to be the judge of what might have gone wrong, while Hilary finds bliss in domesticity, giving up music to live in the country and raise chickens and children with her vibrant husband, Kiffer (David).\nThe cast is superb. Emily Watson, in the very difficult and trying role of a petulant genius, searching for answers about herself, plagued by self-doubt that borders on madness and the need for close ties to home, is brilliantly portrayed, as she reveals Jackie\&#39;s compelling character, showing her supple musical know-how and her erotic sexual liberation and her binding commitment to what she wants to pursue and, towards the end of her life, a spunky grit to deal with her debilitating illness of multiple sclerosis that will take her life in 1987 when she is just 42-years-old, in a most unmerciful way.\nIt is rare that a film has such a meaty part for one woman to play...this film has two such parts. The other female lead, is admirably played by Rachel, as she is solid in her role as the first prodigy child to shine brightly, and as the jealous one when she realizes her sister has caught up with her talent wise and will soon surpass her. We can read her mind as she grapples with her inability to grow as a musician, and when Kiffer aggressively pursues her and weds her, giving her the self-esteem she has always wanted, she will cease to be a professional musician.\nThe girls never seemed taken with a genuine love of music except as it suited their talents. Their strivings for success was at first a reason to be coddled by their ambitious stage mother (Celia), then it became a chance for the sisters to remain close, each sharing the spotlight, and then something mysterious happened, perhaps a twist of fate, that allowed Hilary to fall off the pedestal, while the once weaker performer, Jackie, took her practice to heart just to keep up with her older sister, who now becomes recognized by the world for her musical talent. The stage father (Dance) has a rather interesting role, as the moralist in the family, who is a bit of a stodgy kind of anti-semite (mom,too), whose bemused character might be summed up as he is reflecting on his daughter\&#39;s marriage to Barenboim and conversion to the Jewish religion, &#34;She can\&#39;t be Jewish, she is blond.&#34;\nThe film begins innocently on a deserted English beach, where the sisters played by Keely Flanders and Auriol Evans, happily frolic on the sand, meeting a strange ghost-like woman, who tells Jackie in a whisper, &#34;everything will be all right.&#34; This ominous tone, sets a haunting mood for the film, that will quickly move away from these seemingly happy days of their youth and take them to their adulthood, where distance will separate them, in a way that they could never have believed possible from their early upbringing.\nThe well-crafted screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce, is ably directed by Tucker, who is directing his first feature film. The only fault I found with his direction, is that I thought it was unnecessary to have duplicate scenes of what Hilary and Jackie experienced, that is, we didn\&#39;t have to see it from each one\&#39;s point of view. I thought the film would have been better served if the action was continuous, the going back over the same scenes from a different point of view really killed the pace of the film, slowing it down too much. The sisterly relationship was so powerful and subtle, that when Jackie runs away from Barenboim for no apparent reason and winds up at Hilary\&#39;s remote country house and suggests to Hilary that she allow her devoted husband to service her, we are caught up in the intrigues of a very trying sibling rivalry, that questions sensibility and one\&#39;s mores, all the while testing the sister\&#39;s very genuine affection for each other.\nThis is a film that glows with confidence, sparked by a maturity of material, that tries to unravel some of the mysteries in life that make one wonder about certain decisions made that can impact one\&#39;s entire life. The film worked so well because of the contrasts between the two female stars, they prevented the film from burying itself in a pit of sadness and, also, it was deftly handled by the director\&#39;s ability to keep the movie light, not to make Jackie\&#39;s situation into a downer... And the music helped, it was simply marvelous.\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;MODERNS, THE (director: Alan Rudolph; cast: Keith Carradine (Nick Hart), Linda Fiorentino (Rachel Stone), John Lone (Bertram Stone), Wally Shawn (Oiseau), Genevi=E8ve Bujold (Libby Valentin),Geraldine Chaplin (Nathalie de Ville),Kevin J. O\&#39;Connor (Ernest Hemingway), Ali Giron (Alice B. Toklas),Elsa Raven (Gertrude Stein),1988)\nParis as it was in 1926 for &#34;The Lost Generation&#34; of Americans: Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Alice B.Toklas, and all the other artists and would be artists seeking to make their name known on foreign soil. Rudolph takes a rather cynical and tongue-in-cheek view of that art scene, capturing the mood and the atmosphere of that period, shooting this highly entertaining and for him, accessible film, in a dazzling display of color, representative of the art produced at that time by Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse and Modigliani. This was actually the first feature film he had in mind, but had to wait to do it until he got backers. His love and understanding of this time period shows up very well, as a result, he creates his best film to date.\nThe plot of the film concerns love, heartbreak, money problems, the meaning of art, alcoholism and finding one\&#39;s identity. Nick Hart (Carradine) is the cartoonist for the Chicago Tribune, living in a garret, frequenting the Parisian expatriate cafes, trying to sell the paintings he works on with all his artistic skills, and earning extra money by forging the paintings of the masters. Oiseau (Shawn) is his friend and colleague on the paper, who writes a gossip column.\nWhen Nick sees the beautiful wife he never divorced, Rachel (Linda), in a Paris bar, married to the ruthless and crass business man (manufacturer of condoms) and private art collector, Bertram (Lone), he tries to win her back. She is dissipated, unhappy with the direction of her life, becoming an alcoholic, and ashamed that she is married to a very cruel and despicable man.\nLibby (Bujold) is a small-time art dealer who tries unsuccessfully to sell Nick\&#39;s paintings. Nathalie de Ville (Chaplin) is the insincere art collector wife of a husband that she cheats on; while also, hiring Nick to forge three of her philandering husband\&#39;s collection of masters for the nefarious purpose of getting even with him. The Parisian scene is topped off by an emotionally sentimental Hemingway (O\&#39;Connor), showing up at all the right parties, sitting at the right cafes, drinking to excess and plying his craft, while thinking aloud, as his philosphy comes off as just so much drivel, with him appearing shallow and hopelessly American despite his presence in Paris at precisely the right time for an American to be there. Gertrude Stein (Elsa) and her friend Alice (Ali), come off as snobs, in love with their own sense of self-importance.\nThough the story might falter at times, with unneeded boxing matches and stereotyped tourists providing unneeded insights into the Parisian scene, what never faltered was how well this film looked and how engagingly it caught the ironies of that period.\nREVIEWED ON 3/1/99\n=A9 all rights reserved Dennis Schwartz\n&#39;,
 &#39;SCENIC ROUTE, THE (director: Mark Rappaport; cast: Randy Danson (Estelle), Marilyn Jones (Lena), Kevin Wade (Paul), Grant Stewart (Jack), Arthur Ginsberg (A Stalker), 1978)\nWe need myths to live by, says the heroine of this film, Estelle (Randy Danson). And somehow Rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this premise, that is similar in some aspects to the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, whereas Orpheus rescued his love from Hades, but even though he was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear, he did look back because of his insecurities and fear that Eurydice would think that he didn\&#39;t care for her anymore.\nThe estranged relationship of the sisters, Estelle and Lena (Jones), is somewhat reconciled as they start living together after a long absence from one another, mainly, because Estelle feels guilty about how she treated her sister before. So she lets her live with her, even though she would rather not have her there. Soon they find themselves in the delicate position of having gone out with the same man, an extremely muted man, Paul (Kevin), who forms a relationship with each of the sisters, first with Estelle and then by coincidence, he meets Lena, but fails to fulfill his fantasy of having a sexual relationship with both of them at the same time.\nThis film is distinguished by its stylish use of opera, classical painting, and Victorian soap opera like-dramatics, to get across its strange wit and Rilkean-like observations of what can be seen from life when you become a passive observer of it. The observer is Estelle, who pictures herself as if she was the one she is seeing when she looks out at a world she feels imprisoned by.\nIt could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters\&#39; personality foibles, as they mock or imitate what the real-life troubled modern heterosexuals in NYC are up to, as Paul acts out the part at being the tall dark, silent type of macho he-man, who is animalistic in his attraction to both sisters: Estelle, with her pretentious romantic soul, who is endowed with beautiful breasts; and her more down to earth sister, who is not the romantic type, but is more prosaic in her outlook toward life, who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems and fits of violence.\nViolence somehow plays into the motifs of the story, as there is talk of a serial killer on the loose in the city, which prompts Estelle to say, &#34;she is afraid to go outside and she is afraid to stay inside.&#34; She even thinks that her ex-husband, Jack (Grant), might be the killer, since he is prone to acting peculiarly hostile at times. But the killer is caught, and it is not Jack.\nEveryone in the film is a take-off of what a real person might be like when they are going through a relationship or when encountering strangers in public places. As for the later, Lena confronts a stalker by coming on strong to him, thusly chasing him away, as he absurdly tells her he should get the cops on her. Everyone is meant to be a cartoon character, ones\&#39; whom you can poke fun at, especially when they take themselves seriously.\nEstelle provides the voice-over, which underscores the striking visual scenery in the background, like the starry sky wallpaper in her room that she is most comfortable with, as she collects her thoughts from the diary she is writing, mixing her keen observations about romance, with comments such as, men are attracted to women who wear a wedding band, because it is like a challenge for them to conquer a married woman, to her consuming jealousy and mistrust of others, even those she once loved, like Jack, Paul, and Lena.\nEstelle becomes a sort of representative of all women who are bitchy, wrongfully hurt in a relationship, or too consumed in their fantasy world of what a guy should be like to ever form a lasting relationship. The film\&#39;s aim is to be humorous about this. Even the final scene, where she at lasts burns her diary (similar to the women lib bra burnings) can be taken both as comic or dramatic theatrics. In any case, this is a very unusual and original work, that is sometimes slow-going, missing the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for its own good; but, more often than not, it is right on the mark, using its token males, Paul, as an insignificant stud, a servicer of the female race, and Jack, as an untrustworthy spouse, perceived as being capable of violent acts, as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly wants in a man, in a most peculiar way.\nThis film should appeal to urban dwellers who have been in a triangular heterosexual relationship and came out of it more confused than when first entering it and to those who have a more tolerant and sophisticated attitude toward impossible relationships. And as Estelle so ably says, after her burning ritual, &#34;I need some new myths for my life, the old ones don\&#39;t work anymore.&#34; This film is a parody of the Orpheus myth, and as Estelle says, &#34;she gave Paul two chances to get her out of hell, but he failed both times, Orpheus was given only one chance.&#34;\n.... Incidently, the funniest line in the movie is reserved for Paul, who tells Estelle, &#34;I wouldn\&#39;t even tell you a lie, much less the truth.&#34; I think that line summarizes what the movie is ultimately about.\nREVIEWED ON 3/11/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;JUNK MAIL (director: Pal Sletaune; cast: Robert Skjaerstad (Roy), Andrine Saether (Line), Per Ergil Aske (Georg), Eli Anne Linnestad (Betsy), 1997-Norway)\nThis Buster Keaton wannabe movie is supposedly a comedy/romance about an inept, morose Oslo mailman, Roy (Skjaerstad), who is not respected by his fellow workers and shows he is not satisfied with his job, somehow taking this frustration out by not delivering heaps of mail, which he dumps out regularly at some railroad underpass and by steaming open other letters and reading them. He is a sleaze, a frequenter of porn book shops and lowlife night spots. His life is a dreary, loveless mess.\nAs if all that is not bad enough, certainly grounds for dismissal from the post office, someone who would upset me, if he was my mailman; but, to top that off, he is also a voyeur, finding the keys to a deaf (she wears a hearing aid) woman&#39;s apartment that she left in the mailbox, and using the key to enter her apartment when she is at work at her dry cleaning job, to go through her things and steal a photograph of her. It seems he finds her attractive, but doesn&#39;t know how to get to tell her this. She is played in a low-key manner by Andrine Saether (Line).\nThis film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful Oslo, where we see crime, ugly buildings, the subway, and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country. The crime we see is Roy being robbed of his mailbag, but his strap gets caught and he can&#39;t even get robbed properly, later on saying he would have gladly given up the bag and avoided the beating the three muggers gave him, that hospitalized him and made him out to be a postal hero for not wanting to give up the bag. The film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off, everything he touches he fouls up, a complete loser-- there is a long tradition of Hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy. His comic effect, is a deadpan expression, that absorbs all criticism that comes his way. His fellow postal workers rag him about what he is good for, and a lady postal worker who wants to stick up for him, can only say that he is a good walker, which causes a round of snickers from the postal workers ragging him. What is funny, is the way he looks at us, as he looks at the camera, showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature, emphasizing to us that he is a natural screw up.\nBut the picture has darker ulterior motives than that, it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story, a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film, we can no longer be content to relax, laughing at this inept mailman, we have to now see how he handles himself under fire, while the director, also, tries to bring romance into the story.\nThe romance that comes to this film, comes in a surprising way, as Roy is trapped in Line&#39;s apartment when she comes home unexpectedly, and he watches her nude as she goes to take a bath, but what she is really doing is committing suicide. Roy saves her by reviving her and calling for an ambulance, leaving the house before she knows that it was him that saved her. There is a dark side to her that is now disclosed, she is involved with a strong-arm thug, Georg (Per), who beat a security guard senseless in a robbery and gave Line the money to hold for them.\nAs far as I am concerned, the film loses track of what it is capable of doing at this point of the story, and it becomes a different film, where one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story suspenseful, with the buffoon-like Georg menacing Roy. Roy is now the subject of a film that doesn&#39;t know if it wants to be viewed as a suspense or romance yarn, or just as a plain comedy. Roy still acts with the same deadpan expression, as a result, everything becomes muddled and ridiculous. The laugh situations seem forced, the romance absurd, and the suspense unreal.\nAt best, I found this film to be a modest effort at comedy, that results in a modest film, barely being less than annoying, but redeemed by showing me the darker side of Oslo, a side that I have not seen before on screen. So I think that this first time director, who is guilty of trying to come up with too many different twists to the story, and by relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable, and a story line that is very thin, has defeated the comic efforts that he was successful with during the first part of the film, but by the end of the film, wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy.\nREVIEWED ON 3/13/99\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#34;ULYSSES&#39; GAZE ( director: Theo Angelopoulos; cast: Harvey Keitel, Erland Josephson, 1995-Greece)\nKeitel, if you stretch your gullability a bit, is a great American film director, returning to his native Greece after 35- years in the states. His controversial films receive high praise or condemnation from the crowds, as this visually stunning film, powerfully opens, with Keitel returning to the small village he was born in, as its faceless people, dressed in black, come out in the open market at night to see a showing of his film in the rain ( now, that&#39;s a real homage to films). There are also ominous riot police, controlling the crowd in fully armed gear. Keitel&#39;s purpose for being there is twofold, he is on a journey (a la Ulysses) to reconstruct his past and he is also anxious to see if he can recover 3 lost reels from the Manakia brothers, they were the first ones to shoot a film in Greece (1905). What fascinates him, is that they saw the century come in with its hopes and aspirations, they were not politically motivated, but were interested in recording what went on with the people and the times they lived in, what was right and wrong about those times, regardless of the mess that resulted from the mistakes the politicians made.\nThis is an ostentacious and mesmerizing film, about a film director&#39;s obsession with the importance film plays in recording history. It is also a film that is bleak and despairing, as it goes on its long and weary journey over hostile territories, where governments could never be anything but inhumane and where revolutions were betrayed and costly. What lingers on, are the lasting images of isolated places, that find in the silence of the landscape a chilling insanity of how cold the world can be. Keitel leaves Greece for Albania, crossing the border in a taxi, taking along an old lady, who has not seen her sister for 45- years because of the war, leaving her off in the most somber of Albanian towns, where she is alone to take in the grimness of the moment, looking up at the cold buildings and deathlike quality to life, as we leave her with a look of desperation on her face.\nErland Josephson plays many different roles as the actress who befriends Keitel on his way out of Albania and into Bucharest in quest of the missing reels. In one of her roles, she plays his mother, as the mother would be in 1945, adjusting to life in war torn Europe. This allows us to see what the director saw as a child. Again, it is a homage to how important it is to record history so that it cannot be forgotten.\nThe journey takes him to Macedonia, Bulgaria, Belgrade and Sarajevo. This allows for the film to wax poetic, to become a meditation on the landscape, to indulge our sense of the incomprehensible, as we see what the film-maker is seeing; we all become foreigners in this eeriness, in this lost century, where the truth has been maimed.\nIts images are always powerful, even if the dialogue seems superfluous and banal. Sarajevo, in the middle of the crazy ethnic cleansing war, is an inhabitable place where snipers shoot at anything that moves. It is starkly photographed in the fog and in the rubble torn buildings where the people barely exist, as they remain there, hoping for miracles to get them by. We watch them rejoice in the welcomed fog, that is welcomed because the snipers must stop shooting till it clears. The fog is the only place normalcy is allowed to be, and even here, the dangers are always in the background. That is the message delivered, from this politically motivated and visually aesthetic film, full of emotion and bereavement for what could have been, but is now ruined by blind hatred. The film is tiresome, at times, too cliche ridden for the potent message it delivers for it be as great as its cinematography is.\nREVIEWED ON 1/24/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;STARSHIP TROOPERS (director: Paul Verhoeven; cast: Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards), Ace Levy (Jake Busey), Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris), Zander (Patrick Muldoon), Sgt. Zim (Clancy Brown), Jean Rasczak (Michael Ironside) , 1997)\nYou can watch this movie, that is based on a sci-fi work by Robert Heinlein, either as a straight gung-ho war film, or you can see it mostly as a spoof. Anyway you watch it won\&#39;t require too much gray matter from your brain cells, because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes, or you might, like me, &#34;think&#34; that this film is so bad that it really couldn\&#39;t be this bad, I must be missing something. But I have come to the conclusion that this insipid B- movie, is that bad, despite the high production costs it took to make it.\nIf there are any good parts to this film, it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner, such as this one, that makes light of the film\&#39;s heavy assault on our sensibilities, as one soldier is telling the hero of the story, &#34;You\&#39;re good at killing bugs.&#34; This came after a big battle between the two opposing armies.\nBasically, the film should be seen as a war movie, because its spoof of the military, grew thin very fast for me, as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped, going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place, that by spending so much time with spoofing the military, is just plain unnecessary. It is the last half of the film that takes over the movie, anyway, as the film becomes all about killing the bugs who have invaded a city called Bueno Aires.That\&#39;s the town all our hero kids come from in the story.\nI guess the film is set in the future, but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics, as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie, that should endear itself to the MTV generation. There is no subtlety to the continual spoofs against the military personnel.The mindless story traces a bunch of high school graduates and their dedicated teacher, well-acted by Michael Ironside, as they all join the military for all the reasons that prevail at the present time for why people join.\nAfter awhile, all the performers looked alike to me, but I wouldn\&#39;t be doing my duty as a movie reviewer, if I should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film, Rico (Casper Van Dien), the school football hero, loves Carmen (Denise Richards), the school beauty and math brain, who is set on becoming a pilot, which is the reason Rico joins the military. There is some kind of mumbo-jumbo talk among them about the difference between a citizen and a civilian: A citizen does his duty by joining the military and protecting the &#34;Federation&#34;, a civilian makes lots of money and goes to Harvard, as what Rico\&#39;s folks wanted him to do. The other part of the love story is that Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), a football jock and an attractive filly, is in love with Rico, but he spurns her attention. But persistence pays off, she joins him in the infantry, while Carmen falls for her co-pilot, a dude named Zander (Patrick Muldoon), and the rivalry between Rico and Zander is about as thrilling as having a spider crawl up your leg.\nI don\&#39;t think you get much bang for your money out of this film, unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary, then I think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put WW11 into an outer space conflagration film.\nREVIEWED ON 3/14/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;WHERE IS MY FRIEND\&#39;S HOUSE ? (director: Abbas Kiarostami; cast: Babak Ahmedpour, Ahmed Ahmedpour, Kheda Barech, 1987-Iran)\nA young Northern Iranian schoolboy, Ahmed, wishes to return a school notebook to his classmate, who is threatened with expulsion from school if he does not bring in his notebook to school for tomorrow\&#39;s class. The problem is that the student lives in the next village and Ahmed does not know his address. How he gets the notebook to his friend\&#39;s house, turns out to be an odyssey of great human endeavor, as this 8-year-old, looks through wanting eyes at an adult world that is trapped in its own misconceptions. Ahmed has to overcome his mother\&#39;s harsh outlook on life, his grand-father\&#39;s caustic perception of how to raise a child, his strict school teacher, and the adults he meets on the way who are unconcerned with his problem.\nThat Ahmed goes on to the next village, despite warnings of not to go, is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense is the essential ingredient needed, if change is ever to come to a society that is stagnant. The narrowness of life and the barren landscape, are excellent props for the director\&#39;s vibrant themes, shot without professional actors and done in a low key, realistic style. The aims of this film are set too low to make it a masterpiece, especially when you compare it to a Satyajit Ray film, but this is still great cinema, something American filmmakers would be wise to observe. Abbas is not afraid to let his camera do the work, to allow it to follow his student around in real time, so we do get a feeling of what it is to participate in the journey. His relentless pursuit is poetically evocative, depicting life in its raw elements. What more can you ask for?\nREVIEWED ON 1/25/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;NEXT STOP, WONDERLAND (director: Brad Anderson; cast: Hope Davis (Erin Castleton), Alan Gelfant (Alan Monteiro), Hollan Taylor (Piper Castleton), Robert Klein (Arty Lesser), Cara Buono (Julie), Jose Zuniga (Andre De Silva) and Phil Hoffman (Sean), Victor Argo (loanshark) (1998)\nWonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you. You can see its plot developing from a mile away.You are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in Boston, as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles. This is a star oriented film, and the star who carries the film is Erin (Hope Davis). That this is a dating film, about singles who for reasons of fate or luck, or whatnot, have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers, is nothing new, this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films. The fictionalized documentary UNMADE BEDS did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film.The main quirk in the plot here, is that Hope\&#39;s pushy mother (Hollan) visits her in Boston, sees her daughter\&#39;s live-in relationship with a radical protester (Hoffman) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her Harvard medical school drop-out daughter, who works as a nurse. This is done without her knowledge. It is cornball sitcom stuff, but, at least, it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director.\nIt is easy to like Erin, she is bright, caring, and attractively blonde. It is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with, the financially strapped, ruggedly handsome, intelligent 35-year-old Alan (Alan), who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist. Of course, he comes across as being so good (though, he does kill some fish in the aquarium), that it is hard to believe he\&#39;s for real, or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for. The contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as, the subway, at a restaurant, or on the phone.\nAlan\&#39;s brother answers Erin\&#39;s ad with a few of his pals, as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way, making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her, that the others witness, will win the bet. This sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told.\nThat we have to see Erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are, each one more annoying than the other, culminating in the most obnoxious one of all, that Brazilian lover (Jose), who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman, who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in Brazil, was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story.\nAnyway, as expected, all\&#39;s well that ends well, for this watchable piece of fluff, that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line. The dialogue was actually not bad, those dating Erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation. And, oh, by the way, Wonderland refers to the stop on the Boston metro, it is where greyhound racing takes place.\nREVIEWED ON 2/24/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;FIREWORKS (director: Takashi Kitano; cast: Takashi &#34;Beat&#34; Kitano(Yoshitaka Nishi), Kayoko Kishimoto(Miyuki), Ren Osugi(Horibe) Susumu Terajima(Nakamura), Tetsu Watanabe(Tezuka), 1997-Jap.)\nWriter-director/acting star-artist, Takashi Kitano, has broken ground from traditional films, taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film, that sways between the two extremes, and as the critic Joel Hoberman so astutely states, FIREWORKS is a cross between Ozu\&#39;s LATE SPRING and Don Siegel\&#39;s DIRTY HARRY.\nKitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women. His forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography. One should expect the unexpected from his films. The violence is brutal and fast-paced. For his effort, he has won the Grand Prize at Venice, the first time a Japanese film has done this since RASHOMON (1950).\nNishi (Kitano), as a detective, is part of a gangster stakeout with his partner, Horibe (Osugi), and two younger detectives. But Horibe tells Nishi to visit his hospitalized leukemia-stricken wife, Miyuki (Kishimoto), and dismisses the other two policemen. This turns out to be a bad move and Horibe is paralyzed by the gangsters. The narrative is told in flashbacks, so any part of Nishi\&#39;s life could pop up on the screen, and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding, deceptively turns out to be much more than that, even as Nishi gets revenge on the yakuma\&#39;s who did this to his friend, unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen. For one of the punk gangsters, he sticks a pencil in his eye. You better believe that caught my attention. But, if that was all this film was about, the DIRTY HARRY description of the film would have been completely apropos.\nFeeling responsible for Horibe and grieving for his wife, the film turns into a road movie as he escorts his wife to the sights she wants to see for the last time, leaving him to wonder why she would choose to see snow before dying... He shows great tenderness toward his friend Horibe, and in his taciturn manner (he is not a man who likes conversation), he sends him art materials so he can somehow keep his mind occupied during the suicidal period he is going through, and we see some magnificent surreal and colorful drawings as a result, which are the actual drawings of Kitano. In between these grand gestures, he violently confronts the gangsters responsible for his friend\&#39;s condition.\nThis highly original film, that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade B- movie, is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on Japanese culture, but the Japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on Japanese conformity, while the Japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian, even if his films have not been as well received in Japan as they have been in foreign countries. As far as I am concerned, I prefer Ozu, I am more taken with his intellect and perspective, but I can appreciate the artistic direction Kitano is taking his violent subject matter to, as I found this volatile film to be something special, but something I can\&#39;t completely comprehend because I don\&#39;t really know what he is trying to say, as if that really matters. Yet his film is a visual treat to behold, and for that I am grateful and accepting of his work.\nREVIEWED ON 2/15/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;SHE\&#39;S SO LOVELY (director: Nick Cassavetes; cast: Sean Penn (Eddie), Robin Wright Penn (Maureen), John Travolta (Joey), Harry Dean Stanton (Tony \&#39;Shorty\&#39; Russo), Debi Mazar (Georgie), Gena Rowlands (Mrs. Green), James Gandolfini (Kiefer, the neighbor), Susan Traylor (Lucinda), Kelsey Mulrooney (Jennie,Eddie\&#39;s daughter), 1997)\nWe have to wait until the near end of this love triangle, a bleak drama about lowlife angst, to hear the words of the Cole Porter tune, of which this film takes its title from, spoken by Eddie (Sean) to Joey (Travolta), &#34;She doesn\&#39;t love you. She doesn\&#39;t love me. She\&#39;s...delovely.&#34; But even these words don\&#39;t make sense, as we find out soon afterwards, that their wife definetly loves one of them more than the other. Maureen (Robin) is the ex-wife of Eddie and the current wife of Joey. She is also the real-life wife of Sean.\nMaureen and Eddie are a couple, who love each other madly, but have many problems such as booze, drugs, and Eddie\&#39;s habit of disappearing from time-to-time. During one of these disappearing acts, the pregnant Maureen is savagely beaten up and probably raped by her neighbor, Kiefer (Gandolfini), but when Eddie returns, she is afraid to tell him this, fearing he will kill the neighbor. So when she lies to him and tells him the marks on her face are from a fall, he doesn\&#39;t believe her and goes into a rage, forcing her to call EMS. But this backfires and Eddie shoots one of the attendants, as a result he is sent away to the mental house for 10 years. When he gets out, his wife who never visited him while he was institutionalized, has divorced him and remarried a successful construction company owner, Joey, who raises the 9-year-old she had with Eddie, plus raising their own two daughters. But she now must choose which is the one she really loves and wants to stay with.\nThe film wants to look like a &#34;hip&#34; independent movie, even though this John Cassavetes\&#39;s scripted work (he died in 1989), directed by his son, is a Hollywood produced movie. It ends up looking not quite like a John Cassavetes independent film should look. It seems to be written as if someone thought that it would be cute to keep leaving out key parts to the story. As a result, the film suffers from incohesiveness, but because of the caliber of actors involved, they make a Cassavetes sandwich seem like it is a Cassavetes sandwich, even if there is not much real Cassavetes in the sandwich. In other words, the story just wasn\&#39;t there, it didn\&#39;t seem to be original, and this from a script by the real McCoy of indie films, is astonishing, to say the least, even the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of THE GRADUATE.\nThe film, however, managed to be entertaining. It just mostly lacked insight into what these characters were about. Nothing was resolved or could be fully understood. For example, it made no sense to think that Eddie was well enough to be let free from the institution and still didn\&#39;t know that he was there for a decade not for three months. Too many other things about the movie were either murky or didn\&#39;t add up, unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable.\nWhat worked for me, was the comic reactions by both Stanton and Travolta, it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the Penns. I also thought that Gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on screen. He held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor. Without them, this film would have taken itself too serious for the untasty Cassavetes sandwich it was trying to serve its too willing captives in the audience.\nREVIEWED ON 3/3/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;GENERAL, THE (director: John Boorman; cast:Brendan Gleeson (Martin Cahill), Adrian Dunbar (Noel Curley), Maria Doyle Kennedy (Frances Cahill),Sean McGinley (Gary), Angeline Ball (Tina), Jon Voight (Ned Kenny), Eanna MacLiam (Jimmy), Eamonn Owens (Cahill as a kid), 1998-Ireland)\nThis B/W film is based on the real-life criminal known affectionately by his cohorts as, &#34;The General,&#34; Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson). It begins by him getting executed in front of his swanky house, by a lone IRA member. The film immediately flashes back to his squalid birthplace, showing him as a kid, played by The Butcher Boy\&#39;s Eamonn Owens, as he was growing up to be a criminal, sent to reform school and almost molested and then beaten by a priest. It seems it was in his blood to be bad. He grows up to despise anyone who isn\&#39;t from his old neighborhood or part of his gang. Priests are assigned the role of being pederasts, which leaves Cahill with a bitter opinion of religion and any authority figure for the rest of his life. The IRA and the Protestant Loyalists are lumped together with all politicians as assholes. The police are simply pigs. Voight plays the neighborhood cop who tried to befriend the youngster, but was spurned by him. He is pictured as a straight but not too swift cop; early on in Voight\&#39;s career, he is doing his sworn duty to kick the poor out of their homes, and as his career is shown moving parallel to Cahill\&#39;s, we see how he rises up the bureacratic ladder of the police to become an inspector, until he is thought of by Cahill, to be just as dirty as he is, a sort of alter-ego.\nCahill finds romance with Frances (Kennedy) and Tina (Ball), who happen to be sisters, as he lives happily with both of them, raising kids and supporting them with the loot he steals on his capers. He is a devilish little fatty, certainly not looking the part of a big time hood, as he loves to wear self-deprecating T- shirts with pigs and slogans on them, he also makes a habit of trying to hide his face wherever he goes in public or when the police interrogate him. I guess these character quirks are supposed to make him somewhat appealing, or show that he has some kind of psychological failings.\nWhen we talk about Cahill, we are not talking about a Robin Hood, even if that\&#39;s what he fancies himself as; as he steals from the rich only, but that is only to line his own pockets, and once in a while, he helps out those from his old neighborhood. He does that mostly to gain favor with his people, so that they don\&#39;t rat him out. He is also shown as being brutal, threatening court witnesses, and finding loopholes in the law to get him off, anyway he can, no matter who he hurts. The film, to its credit, did not make him out to be a good guy. But the story is skewed in his favor, making everyone else who opposes him look like suckers.\nI think if you look objectively at this rogue, he is rotten to the core, or as Voight more appropriately says, he\&#39;s a scumbag. He shows no feelings when he learns that 100 honest working stiffs are layed off their job when the Jewelers he robs goes out of business because of the robbery. He shows no feelings robbing houses and living off what he steals. I wonder how many critics who raved about this film because of Cahill\&#39;s winsome mannerisms, would still like this character if he robbed them. And that is the point of this slickly done, methodical film, that makes it impossible for me to fall for the story, I just don\&#39;t care what happens to him. His life story bored me. I thought of him robbing houses in a miner\&#39;s helmet, being a smooth cat burglar, as merely clever filmmaking, capturing what is sort of odd to watch, as this fat guy bounces around and is so agile. It was great casting, making Gleeson the lead. But I still find nothing in his story that appeals to me about him. I was not impressed with his remorse after he nailed one of his gang member\&#39;s hands to a pool table, after he thought that he was stealing from him. Cahill is just a scumbag, and Voight was right. In fact, the film could have been more interesting if it was about Voight. I found him to be the more fascinating character in the story. Sometimes just being ordinary, hides so much more about a person, and Voight seemed to have heavy things on his mind, that might have been more interesting than following this dead-end, obvious tale.\nThe robberies he pulls off we have seen done countless times before on film. So all the precision planning that goes into robbing the museum of all its valuable paintings, and the chase scenes via car or scooter, were all well done, but so what! This film\&#39;s theme has been done too many times for me to be carried away by such direction. I wanted something else from this film, but I didn\&#39;t get it. What I got was a masterful performance, that I can\&#39;t deny, from Gleeson, and a director who can be magnificent in setting a playful confrontational tone with what he had to work with and letting the camera do its job... If I wasn\&#39;t revolted by Cahill as a criminal, I would be inclined to rate this film much higher.\nREVIEWED ON 3/16/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;CENTRAL STATION (director: Walter Salles; cast: Fernanda Montenegro (Dora), Marilia Pera (Irene), Vinicius de Oliveira (Josue), Soia Lira (Ana) and Othon Bastos (Cesar), 1998-Brazil)\nHow receptive you are to this well-told but unoriginal and very sentimental Brazilian film about a miscreant old woman named Dora (Fernanda), a former teacher and now a letter writer in the Central Station of Rio; and, a 10-year-old orphaned boy, Josue (Vinicius), whose mother has just been run over by a bus as she leaves the letter writer after writing a letter asking her drunken husband who abandoned her and the kid years ago to get back with them again, depends on how much you mind being jerked around, as if you were on a chain and could be pulled on it at any time.\nThough, I gladly admit, I enjoyed viewing the unusual road scenes in the desolate Brazilian countryside, where the people are poor, ignorant, superstitious, and craving for a religion that gives them some form of hope for their dismal lives.This former documentary film director, ably showed how religion can be as phony as the government that keeps most of the people impoverished. In any case, this was a place where tourists don\&#39;t visit and films about this kind of Brazil are rarely seen by a foreign audience.\nTherefore, for me, the strongest point of the film is the documentary type of cinematography that went into the parched Brazilian countryside, making the barren land throb with life. The most exciting shots were reserved for the religious pilgrimage the two weary travelers stumbled into, as they were caught in the light coming from the bright torches of the believers, as the two wanderers search for themselves in the darkness of the night. That was pure cinematic magic.\nUltimately, this is a road film, as Dora relents from her hatred of the kid, as she changes her mind after selling the kid to some unscrupulous people who will sell him for adoption. An adoption that could lead to unimaginable medical experiments done on the child. She decides to risk her life to get him out of those unscrupulous hands, and take him to the father who may not even be where the kid thinks he lives. A theme that has been done before, sometimes much better, as in LANDSCAPE IN THE MIST.\nThe film emphasized the built-in misery the heroine has that made life for her to be a grind, but there seemed to be something special about her that the actress was able to bring out from her characterization that made her seem better than what she appeared to be. The only friend she had for company, was her unmarried friend Irene (Pera), a much kinder and happier person than she, who could have been a prostitute, the film did not make that clear, it only hinted at that.\nThe beauty of this tale is not in the story itself, if there is a beauty in the tale, but in the way it affected the two main characters, Dora and Josue, as they eventually find something in themselves that they didn\&#39;t know they had, and they learn how to deal with the bitternesss in their life. Their experience was comparable to a religious awakening. These two rotten apples turn out to be not so bad, after all. How much you like the film, depends on how believable you find the transformation that is about to take place for these characters.\nFor me, it was too much sentimentality and an uninspiring and contrived plot that kept me from warming up to the story. That the woman being transformed from a spiteful person, who made fun of the letter writers and despised children, will become transfixed from an ugly duckling, mad at the world, to an almost angelic figure, someone capable of bringing great joy to the world, was too much for me to accept, all at once. The story turned out just too goody-goody for my taste. I do not trust films that are so contrived, there is something about them that remains phony, that good acting can only mask just so much of that phoniness. And the acting by Montenegro was grand, she is the film, along with the fine cinematography, but even that, is not enough to completely overcome such a stale story.\nREVIEWED ON 2/27/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (director: John Madden; cast: Gwyneth Paltrow (Viola de Lesseps), Joseph Fiennes (Will Shakespeare), Geoffrey Rush (Philip Henslowe), Colin Firth (Lord Wessex), Ben Affleck (Ned Alleyn), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth), Rupert Everett (Christopher Marlowe), Simon Callow (Tilney, Master of the Revels), Jim Carter (Ralph Bashford), Martin Clunes (Richard Burbage), Antony Sher (Dr. Moth), Imelda Staunton (Nurse), Tom Wilkinson (Hugh Fennyman) and Mark Williams (Wabash), 1998)\nThis film doesn\&#39;t claim to capture the accuracy of its Shakespeare production (it even relishes in the inaccuracies it presents; ex., there were no Virginia tobacco plantations during that time frame, there was no Virginia), but the film exuberates in the fun filled spirit and the frolicking nature of the performers and the backbiting that goes on backstage, as it might have been in a 1593 production of a Shakespearian play. The theme of the film is picked up from the literati speculations that a mysterious woman became the living muse who inspired Shakespeare\&#39;s &#34;Romeo and Juliet.&#34; Here she is admirably played by Paltrow, whose impeccable English and regal stature, makes her a most endearing Viola for Shakespeare (Fiennes) to fall madly in love with.\nI had no problem adopting myself to the cleverness of Tom Stoppard\&#39;s screenplay, though I am usually turned off by films that think they can get by on that one note. But this film was witty and except for a penchant to become at times a cliched formula plot type of film, borrowed from thousands of other films, you know, the old underdog against the world story, with the underdog winning the big event in the film, in this case, poor Will Shakespeare against the establishment: that part of the film took away the fresh and innovative dash the film seemed to have on its own terms.\nBut, I was, nevertheless, impressed by the carefree spirit of this romantic comedy, it seemed to encapsulate a feeling for those times when a great poet had to be popular in order to be recognized as great. In school we are usually forced into believing Shakespeare is only for the high brows, not realizing that Shakespeare\&#39;s plays were popular and written and spoken so that the common man could understand them. That Shakespeare was a great bard, there is no argument. But that he was at times too worldly, is fair criticism. This film is very clear about that, as a fictionionalized version of Shakespeare or not.\nHis rivalry with Christopher Marlowe (Rupert) as to who is the better playwright of the time, was amusingly done, showing the vanity and grace of both rivals. I was not taken as much with Fiennes\&#39; fiery performance, as acceptable as it is, as much as I was with the rest of the cast, and especially, Paltrow\&#39;s very appealing performance. Fiennes\&#39; Shakespeare seemed a little too flighty for my taste, I just don\&#39;t think Will was like that and despite this fictonalized account of Will, it still bothered me to see him look so lost, at times. The only performer who seemed to be in the wrong film, was Ben Affleck\&#39;s (Ned Alleyn). You should talk Shakesperian English, if you are in a Shakesperian production.\nHenslowe (Rush) seemed to have some of the best lines in the film, playing the shifty producer, willing to try anything to stay in show business. When asked who is that addressing the actors, by the play\&#39;s financier, Hugh Fennyman(Wilkinson), who will soon comically become stage struck, he says, &#34;That\&#39;s no one important, that\&#39;s the author.&#34; Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth) played the queen with authority, mopping up the screen when she was on, with her commanding presence and sharp tongue going at full steam.\nI found it to be an enjoyable film, full of life and tongue-in-cheek humor to sustain its colorful story within a story, of the needy Will, on the advice of a therapist, told to seek some romance to regain his writing ability.Will, thusly, goes about with the staging of his play and is faced with the political and financial problems that always seem to plague theater people; and with his own hapless love for Viola, which is complicated by her high birth and his low birth, and that she is promised by her father to the cold-hearted Lord Wessex (Firth), who is a nasty character, adding additional spice to the story.This all added to the splendid feel the director gave to this period piece that rises a little above a typical work of this nature, as the parts of the film that were fictionalized were intriguingly and cleverly done, for the most part. What was a lull in the film, was when its story got too clever for itself and resorted to too much ado over nothing...\nBut, after all, there is something mysterious about show business that draws us into its bosom and allows miracles to happen for this not-so-serious look at Shakespeare to be dazzling and refreshing, something Shakespeare might have looked at with wonder, speculating at who this Shakespeare is he is seeing on film.\nREVIEWED ON 2/14/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;THE BED YOU SLEEP IN (director: Jon Jost; cast: Ray Weiss (Tom Blair), Doug (Marshall Gaddis), Beth (Kate Sannella), Scott (Brad Shelton), Mrs. Weiss (Ellen McLaughlin), 1993)\nTruly independent filmmaker, Jost, has completed his so-called trilogy about rural America with this film and has since moved on to self- imposed exile by going to Europe. This extra-ordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter, as the camera is held steadfast, not moving for insatiably long periods of time, picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion, as it looks at an Oregon lumber mill, whose owner (Tom Blair) is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has built-up and worked at for his 50- odd years of life. It focuses on this man and tries to find out who he is, using him as a metaphoric symbol for America, perhaps, emulating Emerson\&#39;s views, as his writings are flashed on screen, exhibiting some sayings from his essays on nature and America.\nBy seeing who this man is, we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life, the fly-fishing he loves to do for the sport of it, his easy and almost gentile manners, and his very definite American persona, as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the Japanese businessmen he inherently despises, and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual, who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others, so the closer we get to him, the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered. The shocker about his life that is about to unfold, comes after he meets a foreign stranger on the street, raving about the day of atonement coming soon and how God knows all, that he should pray with him, but is told by him that he has no time for that, as he feels uncomfortable being around this religious zealot, so he fumbles around with his wad of bills and thrusts a few dollars in the preacher\&#39;s pockets, that are not kindly received by the preacher, as he quickly departs from the preacher\&#39;s shouts that he doesn\&#39;t want his money.\nOur perceptions of him, as a Rock of Gibraltor type, is squelched for good, as we see him come unglued in his very comfortable home, as he interacts with his wife (Ellen McLaughlin), his second wife, as she confronts him with a letter from her college-aged daughter, Tracy, who is his daughter via his first marriage and therefore not Ellen\&#39;s real daughter. Ellen insists on reading a letter addressed to her from Tracy, out loud, accusing him of placing his hands on her private places, as he responds to his wife\&#39;s question, all she wants to know, is it true? And all he can respond, is that he wonders why Tracy is doing this to him, saying that she is probably mixed up. What results is apocalyptic, as the film becomes disturbingly mysterious and evasive, never settling for sure who is telling the truth, but destroying the family as it is. This scene could also be deemed as an attack on America\&#39;s soul, exposing it to questions about truth and character, principles that are put under the microscope, as the story builds to its very tragic outcome.\nThis is one of Jost\&#39;s deepest and most penetrating films, it could even be argued that he has made a classical film, as it forcefully and subtly tells an American story, replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting, that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature, that becomes a part of the people\&#39;s own nature.\nOne of the scenes that I found most memorable, was when the camera panned the diner where Tom was dining with some co-workers and all we could hear, at first, was the muffled conversations of the patrons, as the camera meticulously panned the diner, until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to Tom and his conversation, which became clearer, as this scene played out a daily experience most Americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film. This time consuming shot, is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long non-action shot.This is one of Jost\&#39;s strong points, his willingness to explore territory others fear to go.\nJost\&#39;s film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didn\&#39;t clarify more precisely, but more importantly, it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the American culture that is difficult to come to grips with, as the American landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world, as it asks... But, what does this mean if Americans are not a happy people?\nREVIEWED ON 3/20/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;BOUCHER, LE (director: Claude Chabrol; St=E9phane Audran (Helene), Jean Yanne (Popaul), William Gu=E9rault (Charles), Roger Rudel (Police Inspector Grumbach), Mario Beccara (Leon Hamel), 1969-France)\nThe film opens with Popaul (Yanne), a veteran of 15 years army service, recently returned to his birthplace (Perigord region) to be the town\&#39;s butcher, taking over his father\&#39;s butcher store upon his death, as we see him joyously cutting some slices of meat for the wedding celebration of the teacher, Leon Hamel (Mario Beccara), who\&#39;s marriage is being celebrated in this small old-fashioned French village, as the butcher sits next to the smiling, young and attractive, headmistress of Leon\&#39;s school, Helene (St=E9phane Audran).\nPopaul comes a courting Helene, making her an offer she can\&#39;t resist, he will personally choose the meat she gets, promising her the best cuts available. Why Popaul is not married can be explained by his army service taking him to remote spots on the globe. He did not like the service, saying he saw many terrible things there, so many dead people as a result of war, even though he was only a butcher there, it had an awful affect on him.\nHelene comes from the city; she said she came here to get away from everybody, the reason is that she loved someone 10 years ago, who abruptly left her, leaving her psychologically scarred and very hurt. She found it very easy and gratifying to give all her love to the children. The townspeople consider her to be an excellent teacher, and so she lives happily alone.\nSoon a murdered old woman is found in the woods, who was not raped. This does not disturb our butcher, who comes by the school offering Helene a leg of lamb as if it were a bouquet. Helene, whose whole life is focused around the school, lives upstairs from the schoolroom she teaches in. Popaul is respectful of her, as she chooses to remain friendly but aloof from him, as this strange relationship is bound by a certain chemistry they might have for each other, even though they are very different in temperament.\nThe most memorable scene in the film, is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll, when a red spot appears on it, looking like jam. It turns out to be blood dripping down from a body on the cliff above them. When Helene goes to examine the body, she discovers its her colleague\&#39;s new bride. She also picks up a cigarette lighter that she gave to the butcher as a birthday present. It is puzzling that she doesn\&#39;t tell this to the police detective who questions her. That she doesn\&#39;t say anything, but continues seeing Popaul strikes me as odd. But this is what adds to the flavor of this methodically simple story. The flawed characters are what elevate this film into something other than a straight mystery story, because getting the murderer is not the theme of the film, as much as trying to understand something that is complex about human nature.\nBy now we are familiar with life in the village, we have seen the statue of the soldier in the village square by the schoolhouse everytime someone visits the school, it is, as if he was guarding the sacredness of this school, and is a symbol of how society ruins its young men with untold wars.\nIt is hard to figure what is happening internally in the budding relationship between Popaul and Helene, but it is definetly not a sexual one. Perhaps it could be explained from her vantage point, that she is curious about him and welcomes his occasional company, but does not want to get emotionally attached to him.\nWhen he comes over to paint her house he notices the lighter and retrieves it. All that\&#39;s left for Chabrol to wrap up the film, is for him to have the butcher come face to face with the mistress he loves, and for us to see if redemption through love is possible. It seems that he has been exposed for the first time in his life to someone he can love, but since this respectful kind of love has not fulfilled him, it has instead released demons inside him. Of course, it not clear who to blame for such horrendous crimes, whether it is a father he hated or society, or just something inside him that snapped. That was pretty much the theme Chabrol used in his first film, shot 10 years before this one, Le Beau Serge, which also took place in a rural village. But this time, the theme is more fully developed by a director who has greatly matured.\nThis is Chabrol at his best, equal to Hitchcock. Spinning an eerie psychological thriller, whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in, are painted with a master\&#39;s elegant brushstrokes. It seems films such as this one, never get dated. I saw it when it first came out, I saw it again on video in the early 80s, and I just recently saw it again in 1999. It gets better every time I see it. This time I was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background, the magnificent limestone caves, and the casual manner village life went on, giving this film a very natural atmosphere. As a result, this is a very satisfying film.\nREVIEWED ON 3/22/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;OUT OF SIGHT (director:Steven Soderbergh; cast: George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks, Steve Zahn, Catherine Keener, 1998)\nElmore Leonard novels have become staples for the movies in recent times, they become movies easily translated into money making glossy thrillers, noted for their amusing dialogue and smartly made stories. This film is no exception. It is entertainment for those who like fun pictures, placing no other demands on the filmmaker.\nClooney and Lopez work well together, there is a chemistry between them on screen that belies the unbelievability of the story they are in. Clooney is Jack Foley, anti-hero hero, non-violent bank robber, robbed 200 banks with just a smile, a real smoothy, but he gets caught robbing a bank and is sent to jail in Florida, but escapes. Jennifer Lopez is Karen Sisco, federal marshal, who happens to witness the jail break, and is taken hostage by Jack and his buddy, Buddy (Ving), who is driving the getaway car. They throw her into the trunk of the car and Jack joins her, striking up a friendly conversation, while gently caressing her thigh in the tight quarters they are in. The magical attraction between these two, is very cleverly highlighted in this scene.\nJack and Buddy are off to Detroit to score a diamond robbery, something Jack got wind of behind bars, as a crooked, weasely Wall Streeter, Richard Ripley (Albert Brooks), blabbed to another prisoner that he has $5 million in uncut diamonds stashed away in his house. The only thing keeping Jack from being in wintry Detroit and going through with the heist, is that he wants to romance Karen. She is intent on arresting him and moving up the ladder in the F.B.I. chain of command. But to complicate matters, she is also taken with his good looks and charm.\nThe cast is fine. Steve Zahn plays Glenn, and is as funny as hell as a drugged out thief. Don Cheadle is vicious as Snoopy Miller, ex-con and detestable prisonmate of Jack\&#39;s. Dennis Farina is pleasantly sardonic as Karen\&#39;s dad and confidante.\nThe film is violent, it is sexy, it has romance and comedy in it, in fact, it has just about everything in it, except real intelligence, but then again, what results is a quick-paced actioner, that is easy to watch, and easy for the viewer to let his hair down a bit and be less critical, for this film is a well-conceived star vehicle that works on all cylinders of the entertainment scale.\nREVIEWED ON 1/29/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;DARK CITY (director: Alex Proyas; cast: Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, Richard O\&#39;Brien, Ian Richardson, William Hurt 1998)\nDARK CITY is a sci - fi/noir thriller, that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity. Everything attempted here has been done before, but that still doesn\&#39;t take away from the film\&#39;s feeling of looking like it is an original. Credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city.\nThe film opens with the protagonist (Sewell) waking up in a tub in a hotel room with a murdered prostitute. He is suspected of being the serial killer who is plaguing the city. And since he is not sure if he did it or not, he has a dazed look on his puss, like he will have throughout the entire film. Just then, he receives a call from Sutherland, who displays the crazed mannerisms of a Nazi - type of a doctor, those more concerned about their inhuman experiments than the treatment of their patients. Sewell is warned to get out of there immediately, and sure enough there are strange creatures, who are called Strangers, coming after him. The police are also in pursuit, they suspect Sewell of being the serial killer they are looking for. Hurt is the deadpan, hard - nosed type of movie cop you would see in a 40s noir film, leading the investigation.\nThe Strangers we are told in the voice - over that begins the film, are human-like aliens from another planet, who have altered the memories of everyone in this city and have changed everyone\&#39;s identity, so that no one really knows who is who. They just assume the identity that is secretly given to them. The Strangers have forced Sutherland, who is not a Stranger, into working for them to inject a serum into those whose identities are being changed. The city remains dark at all times, and at midnight everyone becomes unconscious. Somehow Sewell slipped through the cracks of the Strangers, and even though he has no idea of who he is, he knows he can\&#39;t be a murderer. He will become from now on the source of our information about what the Strangers are all about. He will be on the run for the remainder of the film, innocent though he may be, just like a protagonist in earlier noir films, questioning authority and trying to pull himself together, unsure of whom to trust. His visit to the Automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in NYC, but this Automat was cheerless and cold, only its bright lights served as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city.\nSewell fingers a postcard with a serene picture of Shell Beach on it, that he has found in his pocket. Shell Beach seems important to him, but he doesn\&#39;t know why. He sees it advertised on billboards all over town, but when he asks directions to go there, no one can tell him how to get there. Through Sewell\&#39;s interminable questioning of everything, he begins to unravel what is going on. He finds out that the Strangers have telekinetic powers, enabling them to put people to sleep by focusing on them, they can also fly and go through walls, and do mind - control tricks. He also finds out that they came to Earth because they were slowly dying out, they have no individuality, they only live unconsciously. What they want to find on Earth is how humans live as individuals, what makes them think, and what is a soul. They came to do experiments on humans, using them as if they were guinea pigs. Sewell was made to be a murderer and studied to see how a murderer acts before he got away from their clutches.\nSewell has trouble decifering what is real. He questions his wife (Jennifer), whom he does not even know, and she tells him that she had an affair with someone else. He falls in love with her anyway, and the message of the film becomes only too clear, it is in the heart that the individual is born, and the heart can\&#39;t be dissected and experimented with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the imagination.\nProyas has created a visually challenging movie, that is backed - up by some thoughtful ideas. It is the kind of film that UFO\&#39;ers and alien watchers will tell ya\&#39;, see, I told you there was life out there in space. But to others, this is still only pedestrian stuff, it is not the real deal. And the flat acting did not add anything positive to the story. I enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it set. But what diminished its positives, was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be, to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying. I wished that Proyas had enough confidence to allow his visions to do the talking.\nREVIEWED ON 9/27/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;PI (director: Darren Aronofsky; cast: Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Ben Shenkman, Pamela Hart, Stephen Pearlman, Samia Shoaib, 1998)\nPI is an earnestly written and directed, low-budget black &amp; white shot sci-fi film that is made for intellectuals, but shows them in a depressing light. It is about a mathematically gifted intellectual (Gullette) and his obsession as a computer freak with predicting the exact performance of every stock; and later on, when he meets an Hasidic numerologist (Shenkman), he is intrigued to find out if a string of 216 digits is the mystery number that will reveal God\&#39;s true name. This curious story also concerns the price he must pay for his relentless pursuit of knowledge: He shuns people and lives stoically and suffers from poor mental and physical health. His severe anxiety attacks bring on frightening illusionary visions that require him to ply himself with an assortment of drugs. The attacks he gets on the NYC subway are particularly horrifying, such as being followed and seeing a brain on the subway platform.\nPi is the mathematical symbol for the ratio of the circumference of a circle (3.14). Its number has served the public well for generations. But our hero is rebellious of this symbol\&#39;s status quo in society. For him, the mystery of numbers are the most important thing in his life; more important than being happy. Gullette\&#39;s life is wrapped around three principles:1) math is the language of nature, 2) all things can be understood through numbers, and 3) there are patterns in nature.\nGullette\&#39;s life comes apart when evil Wall Streeter brokers wish to use his knowledge for their profit and Hasidim wish to use his knowledge to access God. He terms himself a Jew who doesn\&#39;t believe in religion. He considers his search as pure science, and has no interest in making a profit off his knowledge or in knowing God. But his pursuit of knowledge misses a fundamental point: His mentor and former professor at Columbia (Margolis), share a mutual interest in such data derived from numbers. They play GO and discuss the problems they run into in their work after Gullette\&#39;s computer crashes and he loses his valuable data on the numbers he is working on, the professor tries unsuccessfully to warn him of the dangers of getting too absorbed in his work, so much so, that he reaches a point where he can\&#39;t see the obvious. Margolis futilely shouts out that he should go home and relax, and take a bath: that he thinks too much, he should learn how to act more intuitively.\nThe flaw in this intellectualual characterization of Gullette, is that the director chooses to end Gullette\&#39;s vision and search, by saying it is not so bad that he took out a piece of his brain because of all the problems he was having, now he can experience the ordinary things of life. Aronofsky did not take a stand to point out what he clearly meant by that; that is, unless he believes it is better to be self-satisfied and rational than someone who goes all the way in his pursuit of genius. What is clear, is that Aronofsky blames science, just as much as he does capitalism and religion for the way the world is in turmoil.\nThis is Aronofsky\&#39;s first feature, something he won best director for at the Sundance Film Festival. It is good to see that a film that is so cerebral and difficult to make can so popularly be received by selected audiences and most critics. But this being said, the film\&#39;s popularity still scares me: I think it is popular for the wrong reason. This film, in retrospect, might be viewed as an anti-intellectual film since it emphasizes that Gullette is more appealing when he is not completely absorbed in his intellectual pursuit. Just as the film\&#39;s merits are easy to praise, the film\&#39;s flaws are easy to find fault with. Aronofsky has his protagonist retreating sophomorically into passivity in lieu of his quest; this flaw should not be overlooked, it so seriously challenges the film\&#39;s main character from establishing who he is and from our understanding of what is really being said about intellectuals. I think, it should have been emphasized, that it is irrelevant that the protagonist is an intellectual, because he could be any personality type and that would not alter the fact that he was going through a nervous breakdown, and in essence, that is what has happened to Gullette, who is just marvelous in this very complex role, in a film that gives off a rich aroma of intellectual pursuit, but cannot digest the full intellectual and mystical meal it has cooked.\nREVIEWED ON 10/3/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE (director: Larry Clark; cast: James Woods (Mel), Melanie Griffith (Sid), Vincent Kartheiser (Bobbie), Natasha Wagner (Rosie), James Otis (Reverend), Lou Diamond Phillips (Jules), Brent Briscoe (Nazi drug dealer), 1998)\nThis is a story about two sleazy drug addicted couples: the older couple, the criminal pros, represented by the middle-aged Mel (James Woods) and Sid (Melanie Griffith); and, the younger couple, being broken into the bigger crime game by the old pros, are the teenagers, Bobbie (Vincent Kartheiser) and Rosie (Natasha Wagner, yes, she is the daughter of Natalie Wood). These are not pleasant characters, they are sad and funny; they are pathetic and desperate, but they are definetly not cute or pleasant, and cannot even remotely be thought of as nice people.Therefore what happens to them, is not a primary concern of ours, except we might hope that there is a chance that the youngsters can be saved from their messed up start to life. Violence will become the norm for them from the film\&#39;s gory opening till the end of their little escapade into the world of drug trafficking and heists. This romp, down this tawdry road, fits the acting style of James Woods to a tee, it seems as if he was born to play these over-the-top, quirky, offbeat roles. And since, it shouldn\&#39;t be that difficult to figure out, that this film is glued to its brutally violent story line, directed by a director who relishes sleaze, like some have pangs for Twinkies, you should have a pretty good idea where this road movie is going to take you (Clark\&#39;s previous movie was in the same gritty cinema verite style, KIDS). It is even suggested by Sid in her more comic than gangsterish voice, as she plays with the younger couple, that we are in for a &#34;Bonnie and Clyde&#34; thing, and she was right, to a certain extent. This is the 90s version of that infamous couple\&#39;s story, just needing a bit more violence and some drugs to tell its tale.\nThe film opens with Bobbie leaving his girl\&#39;s bed to break into some warehouse to steal quarters from a vending machine, a security guard catches him in the act and clubs the kid around, almost killing him, the kid pulls a knife on him and slits his belly open. The next shot we see, is of Mel hunched over the kid\&#39;s bed, treating his life-threatening wounds and shooting him up with some H. One of the kids watching this performance even thinks Mel might be a doctor, but Mel shoots back, &#34;That he\&#39;s just a junkie and a good thief.&#34; The next thing we know, is that Mel comes on really friendly to the kid he treated, calling himself &#34;Uncle Mel&#34;, inviting the kid and his girl into his crime organization, telling him that he will teach him everything, he will elevate him in criminology and become for him a junkie role model and a sort of surrogate father figure. The kid very intelligently asks, why me ? And Mel tells him, he can\&#39;t take his sister\&#39;s kid into the organization, (he\&#39;s the one that brought Mel in to treat Bobbie) because his sister would kill him for making her son a professional criminal, and besides, he tells the kid, you\&#39;re small, you\&#39;re just right for the heist job I have planned for a drug clinic, where you hide in a vent.\nWhat comes next is a learning experience for the young couple, as the kids are treated as if they were full blown junkie grown-ups by their new surrogate parents, treated to champagne and new clothes and lots of dope, but the initial thrill of being a hood begins to change for these druggies, who basically would be content just to make love and sniff some drugs, but are now heavily involved on a trip that is too much for them to really handle. As some of their deals turn real violent. The one with some Nazi type motorcycle drug dealers, starts off as comical in a sick way, as we hear some bad ethnic jokes and watch the deal these two gangs have turn rotten, marred by Bobbie and Mel nearly getting killed. After that mishap, the kids want to get out, but &#34;Uncle Mel&#34; has other plans, while Sid takes a maternal interest in the youngsters, sharing Rosie\&#39;s joy in her pregnancy, while trying to stop feeling sorry for herself that she can\&#39;t have children with Mel.\nRealizing that this crime scene might not really be for them, the kids ask to leave, but Mel says one more job, but this is a job that doesn\&#39;t smell right to Bobbie, as he is starting to regain some feelings about who he is. The job Mel has in mind is set up by this flaming fag, Jules (Lou Diamond Phillips), who the kid instantly detests. As expected, the job turns violently wrong, and things get grave for the two couples.\nThis hard-assed film is based on a prison work by Eddie Little. It is only fun to watch in between heists, when the couples interact, with Mel leading the witless wit by being a charming teacher and an unrepentful gangster, with no sense of guilt about killing someone or having any reflections on his sordid life. Melanie is comical in her own right, as the gun moll with a golden heart, who would do anything for her man, but betray her &#34;adopted&#34; son, Bobbie. The kids are druggie misfits, who find comfort in their love and deformities. Their humor comes in small charges of underlying truths, as they tag along mainly for the ride into big time crime, still too naive to comprehend their total situation.\nThe problem with the film, despite its authentically-acted characterization, is what can you make out of it that makes sense. Fortunately, we are given one glimmer of hope in Bobbie, of all people, who is last seen running through the cornfields with a wad of money on him, enough to dope himself up for awhile or for him to get his act together and make something of himself. From what we can gather, after getting a full dose of him in the film, we can only surmise that the kid had better get himself straightened out, because a life of crime is not something that he has a natural affinity for. Since the film can\&#39;t possibly give us much to say about Bobbie other than conveying he is the only one of the four characters who might have a chance of surviving and living to be sixty, we can only hope that this kid with the angelic face, can somehow make it on his own.\nI recently saw James Woods on the Charlie Rose PBS show, where he talked about his love for this film and belief in it, praising its independently directed efforts and sort of castigating the movie industry (Whenever I hear the term &#34;movie industry&#34;, I can only think in terms of business not art) for not promoting this film and others like it that are honest efforts, refusing to make formula type of commercial films. I can only concur with him, just wishing that an independent film doesn\&#39;t necessarily have to be youth orientated or about drugs or violence or sex to sell itself. There are so many other themes out there that have not been so thoroughly explored as these themes have been, and therefore for me to really get on the bandwagon of a film such as this, I just want to see something different already. I am inundated up to my tired eyeballs watching films with the same themes, differing only in the nuances and styles of their story, so that their originality comes intermeshed with one another, causing me to sometimes mistake one film for another. And I think, that is the most critical thing that I can say about this often funny, mostly bleak, derivative film, that was credibly but not compellingly acted, in reality, leaving no visual impact on me, it was too much like feeding on junk food and then going home and realizing that you were not eating a healthy meal and, besides, the enjoyment of it wasn\&#39;t that great to begin with.\nREVIEWED ON 3/24/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;IN THE COMPANY OF MEN (director: Neil LaBute; cast: Aaron Eckhart, Matt Malloy, Stacy Edwards, 1997)\nThis powerhouse of a film is geared to get under your skin and is not, as most Hollywood films are, made to amuse you and cater to your idea of what a romantic film is supposed to be. LaBute\&#39;s debut film is hard to describe, though the plot is simple enough, but this is not a film that depends on plot for it to be understood.\nLaBute looks at men through the eyes of successful thirty-ish corporate types and penetrates their real feelings about women, themselves, and their relationships. He gets us to listen in on what they are trying to communicate to each other. This is accomplished in the sterile, power driven workplace of high tech, where the men who work there make their own rules about what works and roam the sleek corridors of their modern glass offices and hold manly conversations in the immaculately clean bathrooms they feel very comfortable in (a substitute for the proverbial locker room). That what comes out of these conversations, to say the least, is disdainful, but that is not the point LaBute is trying to make, nor does he use these talks solely for shock value. What is taking place is more real than that, and much more frightening. We are made witness to what it takes to be in their company, and we want to puke. We want to say these are freaks or they are not the people we come into daily contact with, or that this is exaggerated, but what is true in a certain sense, is that these are the regular guys we ordinarily come into contact with; the guys cranking out this booming economy, buying condos, living luxuriously lifestyles, not worried about the world\&#39;s problems and the unfortunate; they are the smart movers and shakers of the business world, the ones who are country\&#39;s future and present leaders.\nPlaywright LaBute uses words that are meant to be spiteful and piercing to one\&#39;s fragile ego. The tough business guys understand this, and can talk the talk, and fight for their place on the corporate ladder with seemingly effortless grace, as they constantly watch their backs.\nThe scene with the black intern is bound to rub people the wrong way, as it takes us into the strident relationships these business warriors have, and adds the racial issue as another dimension to its political incorrectness stance. The black intern learns how it is to feel that he is not being humiliated when he is being humiliated by his boss, Aaron; and, at the end of the lecture he receives, he is reduced to a flunky, getting coffee for the boss, that is after he is told to take down his pants so that Aaron can see if he has balls, as supposedly, a secret deal is struck between him and Aaron that will benefit both. We can now be reassured that &#34;the old boy&#34; network will be passed on, even between the races, as the intern is initiated into the business world community.\nAaron, along with his college friend, Matt, who is chosen to be the temporary supervisor of the project they are assigned to by their company, are on a six-week business assignment to this city that LaBute chooses not to name.\nWe are struck by the different personalities of the two- - Matt is insecure and geeky. Aaron is handsome and bold. But what they have in common, is what at first seems most important to them: they have struck out and have been rejected by women, and feel a bitterness to them. Aaron is very vocal about this, and suggests to Matt that they do something about this that might appear strange to him at first, but when he thinks about it, he will realize that it will give him a way to restore some of his self-esteem by getting even with all females (this is, of course, absurd. But the point of the story is, that their life is absurd, so why not get what you want, no matter what you have to do to get it). At least, we have the feeling that Aaron understands this.\nAaron suggests they meet a woman who is a loser and they both date her without her knowing that they are doing this, and they will treat her as nicely as they can, and before they go back to their regular workplace, they will both dump her. Matt is at first put off by this, but soon agrees when Aaron comes up with the victim, a deaf typist (Stacy), who is not bad looking but because of her disability which causes her to talk in garbled tones, has lost her sense of self-esteem. She is the perfect victim for their villany.\nThe movie is not driven by plot, so what unfolds is somewhat unconventional for movie lore (though not for the world of plays, from where the director draws his strength (ala Mamet), which has a much richer history of misogynistic characters being the ones you love to hate). What is here unpleasant and shameful and immoral, is played out to the hilt with all the traumas one could expect. I must respectfully say, this film has balls. No matter how politically incorrect and unbelievable the story might be, it still attracts our attention and makes us react to it on a visceral level. I think that is because we have all questioned our relationships at one time or another and felt a certain vulnerability, and wonder about how that other person now feels, the one who did harm to us, how is he or she getting on. This film does that to us; it provokes us to look at things that are unpleasant in our lives.\nWe realize that Aaron wins because he is a charmer, but those not taken in by sharing his deceits would not be taken in by his charm. He is ruthless, because he understands the nature of the business he is in and is willing to do what it takes to succeed. But we are not really comfortable with Aaron\&#39;s aggressiveness, and out first reaction, is to recoil from him in horror when seeing him so depicted on screen. But I wonder how many Aaron-types we have met in real-life and didn\&#39;t recoil from. As for Matt, he is only too humanly frail, and his insecurities become in many ways too easy for us to identify with for us to care about him. At first, we might tend to be feeling a bit sorry for Matt, but since his weakness\&#39; do not prevent him from being sneakily cruel to others, we soon realize that he might even be worst than Aaron who, at least, is following his natural instincts. And his lies, are the kind that those without a true sense of themselves tell; while, the Matts\&#39; of this world are the humorless types you might have had a morning coffee with and felt you were with someone you didn\&#39;t quite like but didn\&#39;t know why, as they seemed nice enough in the office ambiance, but you know instinctively that you can\&#39;t trust them, that they will harm you if they can, that they just can\&#39;t help being the worms they are.\nStacy is the only one in the film that we are supposed to feel for. She is the passive female who is capable of giving us her blind love. She is the trophy many an aggressive businessman has won for himself, that is, if they can somehow cover up her handicap (I see &#34;her&#34; as a symbol for the dumb blond type the boss marries or has an affair with, except in this case she is the deaf nice/smart girl).\nThe three stars are all excellent in convincing us of who they are in the film. Stacy\&#39;s role might seem to be the most difficult one to pull off, because of her portrayal of deafness and vulnerability, and being &#34;the female&#34; in the film. She becomes a representative for all women. But she is resilient, and we are left with the impression that in the long run of things she will come through this embarrassing episode in her life better than the two men; she is the only one that is capable of knowing what love is, and that is, because she is the only one who could get a glimmer of what the truth is even after being deceived. One can surmise that Aaron is heading down a long road of manipulations and false senses of security, and that Matt is falling apart because he can\&#39;t make up his mind about who he is or what he wants to be, and what he has to do to find himself.\nThis is not a flawless picture, but it is one that penetrates the masculine soul of the competitive capitalistic system that feeds on aggressiveness and getting results at the cost of coming to grips with one\&#39;s more tender feminine side. It is able to captivate us, because its words have power.\nREVIEWED ON 10/7/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;CLOCKWATCHERS (director: Jill Sprecher; cast: (Iris)Toni Collette, (Margaret) Parker Posey, (Jane) Alanna Ubach, (Paula) Lisa Kudrow, 1998)\nJust killing time, four female \&#39; temps \&#39; become workplace friends as they try and cope with work and life in this disarmingly subtle movie, that seems to grow more and more metaphysical by the minute. These \&#39; temps \&#39; are looking for something permanent in their lives. Each is insecure and unhappy. They are looking for a way out of this rat trap.\nToni is introspective and passive. Parker is perky and rebellious. She is very mischievous and depressed because she is not able to fulfill her career ambitions. Lisa dreams about stardom, she is living in a fantasy world. Alanna is in a mental stupor, obliviously going into a marriage that has inherent danger signs to it. The dullness and pettiness of office life matches their real life situations.\nThe plot develops around how tenuous such office friendships can be, and how death-like is the atmosphere they work in, and how frighteningly transient everything seems to be. It was eerie to watch everything break down for these girls--- their hopes, friendships, and self-esteem. And when it was the \&#39; temps \&#39; who were suspected of some office thievery, they see for themselves how far down the ladder others in the workplace really perceive them.\nIn the end, Toni comes off the best, gaining the most from her experiences. She realizes that she should have spoken up when Parker was in trouble, that it is important for the girls to stick together.\nTheir alienation is a national problem for both men and women. That society can be repressive and authoritarian, is still true today, as this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed after all the Women\&#39;s Lib Movement agendas and all the other changes in the workplace that have been accomplished, especially for women, and if these changes have really made life better for them.\nI was most interested in the Parker character because of her spunkiness and her awkward attempts to form real friendships, as they all seemed to be met with some disappointment, and the veneer she chooses to hide behind is so easy to pull off her as a false mask, as she is the one who gets hit the hardest, getting canned from a job that she only has contempt for; and, she is the one who seems the most alone in the end; she does not seem to have support from any of the following: parents, lovers, friends, or even a roommate, who is always away. She seems to be the one who, in actuality, is the least able to take care of herself, which is in sharp contrast to how she conducted herself in the beginning of the film; and Toni, of all people, realizes this, and becomes the only one who comes to her aid, even if it is done indirectly, it is she who writes a job recommendation for her when Parker\&#39;s world has completely crashed, and she does this by using the guile she evidently picked up from Parker.\nA gem of a small movie... adeptly uncovering the need for positive relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace, which might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world. The inability of the girls to function in this modern society, is punctuated by their need to question what they are doing and their need to belong to something that makes sense to them. And even though, no smug answers were given as how to accomplish this, one does have choices; at least, you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation, and not just marking time and staying put on a job that bores you. This movie definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about, and even if it said it in a low voice, its message can be heard above the idle chatter in the office, if you are tuned in to the right cubicle.\nREVIEWED ON 10/1/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;HENRY FOOL (director: Hal Hartley; cast: Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak, Parker Posey, Maria Porter, Kevin Corrigan, 1998)\nI was disappointed in Hartley\&#39;s most ambitious film to date; I expected more than what was delivered. The story is interesting enough, about a passive, sexually repressed garbageman named Grim (Urbaniak), who is content with his sullen life, and a disheveled drifter named Henry Fool (Ryan), who we learn later on in the film has been released from prison for child rape. He is articulate, full of mischievous zest, a scoundrel passing himself off as an undiscovered writer. He influences Urbaniak to write down his thoughts every day, and edits his work, and after they are posted on a local deli\&#39;s bulletin board, a high school newspaper prints the poems and Grim gets a cult following. And as Urbaniak starts to become known through the internet, and eventually wins the Nobel Prize, Henry recedes to domesticity and obscurity. He also seduces Urbaniac\&#39;s nymphomaniac sister (Parker), who manages not to be as funny as she ordinarily is (this is no fault of hers, the script is not that funny for her part). He also seduces Parker\&#39;s mother.\nHenry Fool can best be viewed as an allegory of the good-guys (non-conformist) versus the bad guys (the establishment). For Hartley aficionados, his comedy is still there in flashes, his trademark drone conversations and absurd situational humor: a marriage proposal takes place between Henry and Parker while he is taking a wicked dump, this is the best and most powerful scene in the film. But the film is boring at times and belabors its points, and goes on for too long without seeming to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction; and, is at best, an uneven attempt to say something serious (which Hartley should be applauded for). But the film gets bogged down in telling too many different stories, such as, one of domesticity, neighborhood values, and the business of getting published.\nI wanted to like this film and I thought about why I didn\&#39;t feel comfortable viewing it for a long time after seeing the movie, and I still found that what I got from the film were some chuckles from the zany characters, but what I was not clear about, was what else I was supposed to get from this film. It just didn\&#39;t add up as a work of drama, it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character.\nREVIEWED ON 9/15/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;THE GOVERNESS (director: Sandra Goldbacher; cast: Minnie Driver, Tom Wilkinson, Florence Hoath, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Harriet Walter, 1998 GB)\nA heavy going and at times annoying, but, nevertheless, embroiling drama. Minnie plays a Jewess in 1800s London, whose father is murdered and leaves the family impoverished. She refuses to marry a rich man chosen by her mother, instead she seeks employment and takes a job on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in order to support her family. She hides her Jewish identity because a Christian is requested by the household. Religion acts as an inhibiting and possessive experience throughout the film, as the first time director weaves a tale of alienation and sexual liberation in a Puritan type of setting.\nThe film opens powerfully as the Jewish ritual in the temple is shot in chiarasco. It is easy to realize how difficult it is to break from one\&#39;s religious traditions if you are raised and indoctrinated with it. Minnie has left her world of cities and Jewishness for a hostile gentile world she cannot fathom. The starkness and loneliness of this rural area leaves her agonized and deracinated. She subsequently finds romance with the master of the house, the intellectually gifted Wilkinson (searching for a method to make the photographic image permanent), who is a bit of a prude and a bigot, though not as much as his bored wife (Walter) is, who idly chatters about escaping her lonely world for one of culture. In this perplexing type of atmosphere, Minnie is struggling to find who she is, constantly put off by the foreign Protestant countryside and the restictive family she is isolated with.\nThe flaws in the film are that the direction is at times unfocused, as too many scenes are awkwardly shot and difficult to watch and comprehend. There just seems to be too much internally going on for any follow-up scenes to uncover all the loose ends that remain untied. The Protestant family is way too complicated to gloss over its 19th century life style. The film is too long and boring at times; and, the love affair was not credible considering the lack of passion (these lovers were just not a believable match); and, the film hammers out too many far reaching religious themes that it cannot properly address.\nBut the acting and cinemaphotography are superb. Everyone performs with stagelike perfection. Minnie was alluring in her role as a governess. It makes sense that her romance does not work, that her lies are uncovered, and that she returns to her Jewish roots, vulnerable and ready to find herself again. I, especially, was intrigued by her botanical walk scenes with the repugnant young girl she tutors (Florence), as she forms a genuinely warm relationship with her despite the child\&#39;s obvious faults. Her sexually explicit scenes with Wilkinson added to the religious tremors of the film and the sense of her alienation, but since I did not find their passion convincing, it was difficult for me to believe that their relationship would have taken place.\nTHE GOVERNESS is an absorbing, marvelously acted film, but not necessarily an entertaining one.\nREVIEWED ON 10/23/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;ZERO EFFECT (director: Jake Kasdan; cast: Bill Pullman(Daryl Zero), Ben Stiller (Steve Arlo), Kim Dickens (Gloria Sullivan), Ryan O\&#39;Neal (Gregory Stark), Angela Featherstone (Jess), 1998)\nAn offbeat look at how a somewhat reclusive genius and socially inept private eye (Pullman), as he goes about solving a very odd case, involving blackmail and a missing key to a safety box. Stiller is the loyal underling to Zero (Pullman), around mostly for the comic effect, but, who is unfortunately not given more time on screen to do his thing, who meets the client, the wealthy businessman, Stark (Ryan), and explains to him how eccentric and fantastic his boss is, and how his boss will not meet him under any circumstance. Like Sherlock Holmes\&#39;s dictum: &#34;observation and deduction, and no emotional entanglements,&#34; Pullman follows in the same footsteps as the great master detective, and like Sherlock, needs his loyal worker as a security blanket.\nBy a chance encounter in the gym, where he is stealthily observing Stark, he meets a paramedic, Gloria (Kim), who becomes the only woman he will ever know intimately (just like Sherlock), and again, like Sherlock, his romantic interest is not followed through, as his work becomes his only reason for living.\nThe trail to this bizarre case begins to get hot as he gets to know Gloria and she turns the tables on him and starts to observe him. From there, he uses his powers of deduction to find out what is really going on. The story is funny, somewhat romantic, though at times resembling more a TV series like Columbo than a movie, but in the end turns back to the private eye genre it started out in. I thoroughly enjoyed this uncanny and inventive caper, except for the unconvincing acting between Pullman and Kim (She was too lethargic) -- which made it difficult for me to get involved with their relationship. Nevertheless, Pullman was able to pull off his part of the deal; he was magnificently outrageous; he easily became the character he was portraying.\nZero had a light heartedness about it that was endearing and worthy of that mind solving Sherlock Holmes genre it so alluringly wanted to emulate, but too lacking in overall integrity to achieve more of an original tone to it, than turn out to be a reasonably witty film, achieved under the direction of the young son of the famous film director.\nREVIEWED ON 10/14/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;AS GOOD AS IT GETS (director: James L. Brooks; cast: Jack Nicholson (Melvin Udall), Helen Hunt (Carol Connelly), Greg Kinnear (Simon Bishop), Cuba Gooding Jr. (Frank Sachs), 1997)\nAS GOOD AS IT GETS is a formula driven sitcom, with nothing new added in the way of being fresh stuff, except from the charms emanating from its characters, with the film relying mainly on the comic antics of Jack Nicholson (Melvin Udall) to carry the ball, as an obnoxious curmudgeon, who plays this successful and wealthy writer who at one time was under private therapy treatment for an obsessive/compulsive disorder, which explains his wearing of gloves indoors and outdoors, eating at restaurants only with plastic utensils, and his not stepping on the cracks of a sidewalk (I do the same thing and no one diagnosed me with that pychological problem; but, come to think of it, with me its more of a thing about it being bad luck to step on a crack). When I was taking college courses in psychology, which is quite awhile ago, I learned that this kind of disorder didn\&#39;t have to lead to such ill-mannered behavior as Melvin displays.Which is why Melvin\&#39;s character is more probably a combination of such obsessive/compulsive behavior and a case of rude manners. In other words, he is a turd.\nWell, Nicholson was real funny doing this compulsive schtick that borders on his just being a turd most of the time, but at his edgiest moments, when he crosses the line of common decency and reaches a point where the audience might not like him anymore, he brought the most laughter to the screen. But you could just bet your honest-to-God paycheck, that when he threw that little dog of his gay next door neighbor, the artist Simon (Greg), down his Greenwich Village apartment garbage chute in the opening scene, his character was going to be redeemed by the end of the film.\nThis &#34;feel good&#34; sitcom looking film, goes on and on for a sometimes hilarious but too often obnoxious two hour and more, as if this was an important film with so much to say, that it couldn\&#39;t leave out a scene or two or three, as it manipulated some twists and turns into the story line and managed to show Melvin at his bigoted worst and then at his most generous best. If you believe such readily made reversals, then you are a better man than me, Gunga Din. With Simon, he would go into his fag joke routine, and with the only waitress, Carol (Hunt), who would serve him in his favorite restaurant, where he was a long time diner, but where he was, nevertheless, disliked by everyone there, including the owner, he would poke personal insults at her.That is pretty much the story line.\nIf you believe Melvin has changed or if anything is supposed to happen that is for the better in his character, then I guess you believe something I didn\&#39;t, or couldn\&#39;t, or rather, I didn\&#39;t care if I believed it or not, since I sauced it out, real pronto, within the first five minutes of this flick, that the story didn\&#39;t matter much, this was a cosmetic psychological rendering to a situation that could be real, but that this film was not about real internal changes, but about creating a slickness about its characterizations of people so the audience could have enough laughs at Melvin\&#39;s insensitivity to others and be diverted by that, and walk out of the theater happy to believe that Melvin wasn\&#39;t so bad a guy after all.\nWhat saves this film from itself, is that because the actors are so good, this film is actually a hoot in many different ways besides its great one-liners. The actors are really into their roles, getting down pat the minutia of their characters. Carol, the single parent living with her mother in Brooklyn, wears house dresses middle-aged apartment dwellers there might appreciate, as she walks like she came out of the hospital, which, in fact, is what she does mostly in the film, a captive of her son\&#39;s poorly treated asthma attacks. Melvin walks like he\&#39;s a bit daffy. I love\&#39;d that slide step he had, something like Jackie Gleason did on the &#34;Honeymooners&#34; TV show. His outfits were a bland middle-aged man\&#39;s delight. He\&#39;d fit in on any cruise liner. Simon walks like he\&#39;s the sensitive homosexual artist he is supposed to be. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Frank, the gay art dealer and friend of Simon. He walks as if he is wearing high heels to a Grenwich Village Halloween party.\nAfter a few scenes of introducing Melvin as a turd, the film changes direction when Simon is severely beaten up by robbers and he is forced to come down from his high horse of being so proud of who he thinks he is, and gets Melvin to watch the dog he recovered after Melvin threw it down the chute.The film now proudly states, look at how Melvin has improved since he has fallen in love with man\&#39;s best friend, a dog. By walking the dog around town and bringing it to the restaurant, he begins to make Carol think that he is almost human. When Carol quits her job to be nearer her sick son, the distraught Melvin can\&#39;t get along without her serving him in the restaurant, so he does the unthinkable, without informing Carol he pays for a top-notch doctor for her son, who is able to cure the kid and make Carol eternally grateful to him, but she goes out of her way to make it clear to him that she never intends to sleep with him, even though he has never even hinted at that.\nThe remainder of the film is predictable and pretty much made up of contrived sitcom stuff. The only purpose of following the story from here on in, is to get to hear some of the one-liners, that break-up the tedium of the plot, as Melvin is in love with Carol, and has a chance of scoring, even though she told him never. So what does the schlimazel do, he screws it up by saying the worst thing he can possibly say to her. He even refuses to dance with her, which I found to be a truly funny moment in the film.But the film couldn\&#39;t take a chance of sticking to this unsafe type of humor and went back to its safer plot. And the plot keys in on how Melvin is reforming for Carol, as it goes back and forth, good Melvin, bad Melvin, unsure of how rotten or nice a guy they want to make Melvin out to be by the film\&#39;s end. I wonder how many screening polls they must have had, before they came up with the right box office formula for success.\nIn any case, some of my favorite lines in this flick were, Simon to Melvin, &#34;The best thing you have going for you, is your willingness to humiliate yourself.&#34; Carol to Melvin, &#34;Come in and try not to ruin everything, by being you.&#34;\nHow good it couldn\&#39;t be, at least, has a lot of funny moments to show for its efforts... I must say, I thought Helen Hunt looked a lot like Meryl Streep. Now that\&#39;s a compliment, Helen.\nREVIEWED ON 3/27/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (director:Roberto Benigni; cast: Roberto Benigni (Guido), Nicoletta Braschi (Dora), Giorgio Cantarini (Giosue), Giustino Durano (Uncle), Sergio Bustric (Ferruccio), Horst Bucholz (Dr. Lessing), 1998-Italy)\nThere is no question that one has to be careful about the good taste required when making a so-called comedy film about the Holocaust, not to offend those who have suffered enough already, but that proves to be no problem here, as Benigni went to some Jewish Organizations prior to shooting the film and got their blessings for this project. Besides, I don\&#39;t think there are any sacred subjects that can\&#39;t be touched, it is, ultimately, the quality of the film itself that counts. And if there is another reason for not disapproving offhand the film\&#39;s comic handling of this horrific context, then let\&#39;s bring up the example of Charlie Chaplin in the THE GREAT DICTATOR, though not directly about the Holocaust, nevertheless, it was a light comedic parody of &#34;The Fuehrer&#34;, and it was considered by many, not only to be an appropriate film, but one of the all time great films.The later part of the assessment of that film, is in recognition of that film\&#39;s tremendous power to satirize Nazism. Benigni\&#39;s film just can\&#39;t muster that same power, because it has muddled and sanitized its telling of the story too much, as well-intentioned, as he might have been in trying to tell the story, the power in the telling of it is just not there.What is there, are bits and pieces of the Holocaust\&#39;s human story, that is as horrific a story as any one can imagine, and offers some contribution to understanding the affects of the Holocaust. What he just doesn\&#39;t make clear, is that the Italian Fascists were part of the &#34;Final Solution.&#34; They were not joking around about killing Jews. The proof is the large number of Italian Jews who were killed in the Holocaust. Benigni\&#39;s film offers no explanation for this. A much better and truer film than his, that unfailingly tells about the Italian culpability in the Holocaust, is THE GARDEN of the FINZI-CONTINIS (1971), which didn\&#39;t waste the audience\&#39;s time trying to amuse them with childish antics, instead stayed true to what was happening to the Jewish families in Italy.\nLIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, is the line Trotsky said, before he was about to be assassinated, serves as the rosy title for such a downbeat subject, that is played in a hearfelt and sincere manner, even though, what it offers for Nazi atrocities is for the most part the mildly anti-septic kind, reminding me of STALAG 17, or HOGAN\&#39;S HEROES TV series where the Nazis are pictured as cartoon buffoons.\nHaving a horse painted green, marked as a Jewish horse, makes for a colorful scene and segue to elopement for Guido (Benigni) and Dora (Braschi), but in no way begins to symbolize or explore the deep rooted hatred that would lead to a policy of genocide. To find such truths, go way beyond the scope of this comedy star vehicle, which, instead, uses this serious subject matter for Benigni to contrast his Charlie Chaplin like routines with the threat of genocide that is ominous, while following a story line that will not try to offend anyone, probably not even the Nazis, that much, especially since Benigni calls this story a fable, giving him an excuse to invent what he wants for the film. Let me tell you, the Holocaust was no fable. But yet, because the subject matter is so deadly serious, he is, at least, able to reach a more general audience, drawn to see such a film they would have most likely not seen, but see it because of Benigni\&#39;s comic ability, and in the process, he has vouchsafed for them how insane the world\&#39;s prejudice against Jews has been, as he makes the film\&#39;s efforts seem worthy enough, even if that were all this film would accomplish, that would be plenty. But I believe he does accomplish more, but he does it, by distorting history, until, in the end, he does show the horror and tragedy of the Holocaust, in his own inimical way.\nIn the first part of the film, if you did not know that Benigni\&#39;s Guido was Jewish, you certainly couldn\&#39;t tell, since he just seemed like he was an eccentric, motor-mouth Italian. So, in that sense, this film in a round-about way, is erasing that stereotyped prejudice some people might still have about Jews being so different from others.\nI was not offended by seeing comedy routines take place in a concentration camp; I also was not touched as I should have been with the gravity of the situation, due to the comic effects. And if any one in their right mind thought that by playing some silly child game in a concentration camp they could survive, I got a surprise for them, it ain\&#39;t so.\nThe book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the daily lives of those in such predicaments, is the one by the Italian chemist and former concentration survivor, Primo Levi, whose autobiographical, &#34;I Survived Auschwitz,&#34; shows what it really was like in those camps.That book touched me, even more than the truest film to date that I saw about the Holocaust, SHOAH, did. After you read that book, there can be no illusions that you are in for a game in the park when you are interred in such a camp. Though the Italian Jews had it easier than the others brought to the camp, because they came there pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long torturous years of suffering, nevertheless, it was a place where the survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead.\nThe film is really made up of two parts, each with a very different feel to it. The first part consists of lushly created cinematography, as it tells of the clownish, hyper antics of Guido, as he is an Italian country boy, coming to the Tuscan city in a brakeless car, where he is mistaken for the Italian king as he whizzes by a crowd awaiting the king, holding his arm out accidently in a Nazi salute to keep the crowd away, this is in 1939. For most of this part of the film we don\&#39;t even know if he is Jewish, until we see the green horse and, later on, see the sign on his bookstore saying this is a Jewish place, since he seems to be in some denial mode of what is really going on around him.\nAmid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes, which probably never go out of style, since the audience where I watched the film, howled with uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits, leaving me to wonder why I can\&#39;t muster a laugh. There must be something funny about this physical humor, after all, there is a long line of vaudeville comedians who made people laugh for generations doing those schticks. I guess, this kind of comedy is just not my cup of tea, and if others find it funny and because of it, find the film endearing, then it is just a question of differing tastes. Though, quite frankly, I did think most of the bits were embarrassingly crass; for instance, those contrived scenes where he keeps bumping into his future wife, and the switching of hats; and, the egg- in- the- face routine, I found to be especially tedious, since I find him to be more energetic and a master of good timing than outright funny. But, I also, must say, the first part of the film was easy to watch, it seemed to have a smooth and even flow to it.\nGuido immediately finds romance with the wealthy school teacher, Dora, (who is his real-life wife). It\&#39;s too bad she can\&#39;t act, but then again, this is basically a one man show, so really, she just becomes another one of his props, much like a leading lady in a Marx Bros. movie is used, as a diversion to balance their comedy routines. Guido\&#39;s romance is complicated by Dora\&#39;s engagement to a local Fascist bureaucrat, which gives Guido a chance to pull every string in our hearts, as he goes about winning her love from the typical comedy film foil, her buffoonlike Fascist lover plays. This material is shamelessly old hat, it is only effusive because the star is so frenetic and nimble and manipulative on screen. But there were also some clever bits, like his speech, though not original, it still hit the mark, as he pretended to be a school official, giving a talk on racial superiority to elementary students where Dora teaches, using his body as an example of all his superior Fascist parts, such as his belly button, which is a good Fascist one. Guido does this, while working for his uncle as a waiter.\nWhen the scene changes from the greenhouse he enters with Dora after their elopement, and it is now 1945 and he is happily married to her, the tragedy of their situation finally hits home, and part two of the film turns grim, as the loving father of a five-year-old, is arrested by the Fascists and along with his son, is taken cattle-style by train to the camp. His wife who is not Jewish, is not arrested, but she insists on going to the camp with them. In order for the father to allay the child\&#39;s fears, he says it\&#39;s all a game and who ever scores 1,000 points will win a tank, a real one. This prize is valuable to the kid whose favorite possession at home is his toy tank. This game idea could probably work for as long as a train ride from Italy to Germany, but for anyone to think it could work inside the camp, that would be ludicrous on their part to think so. The camp they were in, seemed more as if it were a coal mine then a death camp, and Guido was stuck with a bad coal miner\&#39;s job, with really rotten bosses and working conditions. The Jews in the camp looked so well fed, that it was hard to believe that they were in a concentration camp.\nThe kid was perky and wide-eyed and intelligently precocious, just right for the part, and the only other person who caught my attention in a multi-dimensional performance, where you could at least find some variable expressions on their face, was Horst Bucholz, as a Nazi doctor, who was waited on by Guido in his uncle\&#39;s restaurant and is now a doctor in the camp, insensitive to Guido\&#39;s new position in life, but still showed enough cognition for him to save his life by making him a waiter in the camp. Everyone else said their lines in a flat monotone voice that projected bad acting and because of that, almost made a mockery out of their roles. Naturally the comedy routines did not work inside the camp, except for the bit where Guido translates the rules of the camp for the German guards, as he makes it seem to the kid that what he is reading are the rules for the game they are playing, as he explains that the guards are only acting mean because they are part of the game. No one laughed in the audience, but this was funny in a way that you wouldn\&#39;t laugh out loud funny. Some slapstick was tried, such as Guido\&#39;s comically high stepping walk, but that got no laughs. But mostly, for this part of the film, the emphasis became on this game he was playing for his kid\&#39;s sake, his love was so great for him, that he would do anything to save his life. Audiences could relate to that, and that cleverly became the focal and selling point of the film. That is primarily why this film won an Oscar for best foreign film, its comedy alone would not have been enough.\nThe film, to its ever lasting credit, was able to clearly depict Jews as human beings, not as objects to be reduced to soap or buttons, more human than the Nazis, who have disqualified themselves from being a civilized regime by their inhumanity.This leaves the masterminds of racial superiority with their own absurd philosophies of intolerance.\nWhere I think LIFE IS BEAUTFUL succeeded most, is being a film that inadvertly, without probably really being fully aware of what it was doing, showed how unprepared the Jews were for this tragedy by being in a state of denial. After the Holocaust, the rallying motto of the surviving Jews was &#34;Never Again.&#34; And what they learned from this event in history, is to be vigilant and not be in a state of denial about prejudice ever again. Which is one of the reasons why the Holocaust is such a touchy subject, and one has to be careful about how one presents it to others, lest one forgets its dire consequences. And as unbelievable as it may seem, LIFE IS BEAUTFUL, somehow or other, caught an interesting aspect of the Holocaust, with an original take on how passive the Jews were, something few films really make a major point of, for one reason or another. Most Italian Jews stayed put in their home country until the moment was too late for them to leave, never believing that the absurd philosophy of the Nazis could be taken seriously. Guido, at this time, is in the bourgeoisie social strata, being a bookseller, not wanting to give up on his country; while, at the same time frame, Primo Levi, was an Italian resistance fighter, captured and sent to the camp.\nDid the film do enough to show the horrors of genocide ? For some people it evidently did enough to leave them beguiled by the improbable mix of comedy and a Holocaust. The uniqueness and likability of this film, is that Benigni exploits his comic talents to take advantage of a very difficult situation, using comedy as a weapon. But this is most definetly an example of the rewriting of history, by seeing the Holocaust as if it could almost be perceived as comical and not quite real, as a fable, depending on the audience itself to know fully well what happened, where only by the very end of the film, is there a realization that something terrible has happened and a tear could be shed, does a disservice to how history and the victims of it look at it and fails to recognize how little people not directly involved with the Holocaust actually know about it.\nThere is a reason why films are popular, and that reason is that people want to see what they like on screen, they as a rule, do not like to think about things that are unpleasant to them, and this film has deftly and arbitrarily accomplished that by skimming the surface off all the horrible things they could have seen, instead, it subtly goes about its business by hiding from the audience what really happened to the Jews in those camps by not showing how real their plight was.This film seemed almost like it was primarily a very personal film about a father\&#39;s love for his family and his great sacrifice for them, rather than a Holocaust film per se.\nThat the world is still filled with hatred, filled with other genocide campaigns, and not filled with enough people throughout the world with enough courage to put a stop to this attitude, is as plain as day. I still think that most of the world is at a low stage of the evolutionary scale and ready to do a Nazi-style thing all over, if given the chance, just check out the recent Serbian-Kosovo conflict for affirmation that ethnic cleansing has not gone away with the end of Nazism.\nSo what can a film do ? Probably, all it can do is show what really happened, and it doesn\&#39;t matter if its method is drama, comedy, or even a musical, as long as it is meaningful. I intend to be very critically tolerant of this film and say, that even though it struck me as a rather thin Holocaust story, it is still a worthwhile film for those who don\&#39;t want or can\&#39;t handle the heavier stuff, and are not put off by the comedy. They will find, if they look hard enough and look past what Miramax promoted for its own purposes so it could win the Oscar, a film that is more complex than it appears at first glance. But they will also find, that it is a film that still makes it evident, that the world still is in denial of what really happened, and can only look at the Holocaust in a rather superficial way, even after all these years. There is still an element of world guilt, that because of that, will so highly reward this film with honors, even if the film has shown that it cannot open up both its eyes to see how real the Holocaust was. But, I guess, we should thank Benigni for at least opening up one eye, and letting us see that both his film\&#39;s take on the Holocaust and most of the world\&#39;s take on the Holocaust, is still bonded by denial about how they view the Holocaust, which is the same mistake the Italian Jews made when they denied the obvious, what was right in front of their noses, until it was too late.\nREVIEWED ON 3/29/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;A SIMPLE PLAN (director: Sam Raimi; cast: Bill Paxton (Hank), Billy Bob Thornton (Jacob), Bridget Fonda (Sarah), Brent Briscoe (Lou), Gary Cole (Baxter), Becky Ann Baker (Nancy), Chelcie Ross (Carl, The Sheriff), Jack Walsh (Tom Butler), 1998)\nThis is Raimi\&#39;s attempt to go mainstream with an art film thriller that might have an appeal to an audience that likes films that give them some ideas to ponder. This wintry morality tale, its bleak snowbound midwestern atmosphere reminds me a lot of FARGO, without the comedy, as it examines the character of three small town locals who have no worldly experience, but have adjusted in one way or another to their lot in life.\nHank Mitchell (Paxton) figured out that it is the simple things in life that make one happy and he\&#39;s a lucky man because he got everything he basically wants: a pregnant wife that he loves, a respectable job in a feed store, a college education, a home, and the respect of the townspeople where he has lived all his life. His brother Jacob (Thornton) is his opposite: a born loser, he can\&#39;t hold a job, has never even kissed a woman, drinks heavily, is uneducated and lacks all his wits; Nevertheless, he gets by, satisfied to be living a rather plain and childlike life, satisfied to go hunting and chat with someone who talks his talk; his crony Lou (Brent), a married 40-year-old, who is unemployed, the town drunk, a high school drop-out, and of a volatile nature.\nTheir three lives would change forever when chance intervenes and they find a crashed plane buried in the snow with 4.4 million dollars. The question arises what should the three of them do with the money.\nHank, the responsible one of the trio, decides that they better come up with a plan, a simple plan, and that if they don\&#39;t want to turn the money over to the police, which is what he suggests they do, then they must agree to let him keep the money until the spring, so that when the plane is discovered, they will at least know if this is stolen money.\nThe trio are all perfectly cast, with Billy Bob Thornton in a supporting role, becoming caught with his brother in a series of bad judgments that results in the most terrible consequences for them. Billy Bob is particularly outstanding in his true-to-life characterization of such an individual.\nSarah (Bridget) makes the most of her small role as the rational wife who gets involved with her husband\&#39;s plans and connives to help him alter his plans. But as a result, her interference makes things worse.\nThings get completely out-of-control for the trio, as things turn awfully bloody. This is a dilemma for the filmmakers, there seems to be something devoid about this tale that can\&#39;t surface, except in outwardly visual terms, as we clearly see how morality is drawn in terms of black and white. There is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane, as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the film\&#39;s morality play.\nThe result of all the trio\&#39;s bungling, is that things are no longer simple for them, as greed and their extended version of the American dream, but this time earned the too easy way, via a suitcase full of money found in the snow, becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility, as all their character flaws become magnified, and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found. Jacob\&#39;s character ranges between vulnerability and menacing danger, as the bonds between brothers is tattered and redefined for ever, as the brothers must face up to who they really are and how they will both relate to Lou, as even the placid and morally proper Hank has begun to spiral downward, almost lost in a nightmare he no longer has control of.\nThis is a strong gut-wrenching suspense film, one of the top ten of 1998. But the film is just lacking something, and I think that thing it needed, was a breath of vagueness about what is morally right or wrong in order for the story to remain on an even psychological/spiritual keel and not descend into a literal Biblical morality theme. Raimi did a superb visual job, carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains, a difficult task to do, but one that he succeeds in without question. My feeling is, that in due time, we will look back at this film and wonder how it was overlooked by so many, as it will become recognized as one of the great suspense classics.\nREVIEWED ON 1/14/1999\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND (director: Richard Kwietniowski; cast: John Hurt, Jason Priestley, Fiona Loewi, Maury Chaykin, 1997-UK)\nWithout John Hurt\&#39;s magnificent performance, he appears in every scene and is very apealing, this film would have fallen flat on its face. He plays a reclusive, stuffy Londonite, scholarly writer, in scorn of modern society, living in an immaculate library-like house that has none of the modern everyday technology most people take for granted in America and Great Britain, such as a TV, VCR, microwave, computer, and so on. He is stubbornly set in his ways. And as we are introduced to him, we find him to be a bit arrogant, as well as someone who is out of touch with reality.\nHe goes by the name of Giles De\&#39;Ath, which fits the prudish image this recent widower conveys, his name also comes awfully close to being pronounced as death is. Oddly enough, he never goes to the cinema (I could not even imagine anyone living without going to the cinema). But his life changes drastically after he gives a BBC interview and begins to open up a bit; and, after talking with a colleague, he daringly goes to see a film based on an E.M. Forster novel that is playing in a multiplex theater. Since he has no clue about how these theaters operate, he mistakenly ends up seeing something called HOTPANTS COLLEGE 11. Lo and behold, he at first thinks he is watching the Forster movie and is disgusted with it, but as he is about to exit he suddenly falls in love with one of the male stars of this soft core porn film, an aspiring actor (Ronnie Bostock), engagingly played by Jason Priestley. This changes his life, as he decides to become the foremost expert on Bostock\&#39;s life, researching all the films and magazine interviews he has done. It is like he becomes a teen-ager again, hiding the filthy magazines from his housekeeper and somehow managing to buy a VCR to watch these films. It is amusing to see that when he gets home, he doesn\&#39;t realize that he has to have a TV to see the videos.\nBut this is not enough of a challenge for him, so he decides to fly to Long Island where Bostock lives with his girlfriend, the glamorous model, Audrey (Fiona). He uses his charm to get to meet her, and will soon meet Bostock when he returns from L.A.. We get a tour of Long Island (ugh!). And we watch how Giles changes, seemingly becoming a more gentle and sensitive person, but his love is not returned by Bostock in the physical way he wishes it returned, who handles himself with dignity over Giles\&#39;s mistaken advances. What remains interesting to ponder further is the relationship between the two males. It is the old opposites attract syndrome; in this case, it is trashy pop star meets a scholar from a former century, and only the scholar falls madly in love, as the trashy pop star is only interested in the class and knowledge that the scholar exudes.\nThe comic effects of the film seem light enough, that is until the homo-erotic pulsations become overbearing, and we are left, in the end, with a rather awkward drama being played out, that is somehat unnerving to behold, made plausible only by Hurt\&#39;s presence as a commanding performer. Yet it is tastefully done, but not as biting as Thomas Mann\&#39;s film version of the same theme, DEATH IN VENICE. The message of LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND could fit either pop or aesthetic culture, coming to the conclusion that love is strange. I believe Mickey and Sylvia had a 1950s hit song about that theme.\nREVIEWED ON 1/24/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;DIARY OF A SEDUCER (director: Daniele Dubroux; cast: Chiara Mastroianni(Claire), Melvil Poupaud (Gregoire Moreau), Hubert Saint-Macary (Hubert Markus), Mathieu Amalric(Sebastien), Daniele Dubroux (Anne), Jean-Pierre Leaud (Hugo), Micheline Presle (Diane), Serge Merlin (scientist), 1995-Fr.)\nThe movie is very loosely adapted from Soren Kierkegaard\&#39;s early treatise on beauty, infatuation and the power of intellectual persuasion. An old copy of the Danish philosopher\&#39;s work is passed from person to person to act as a love potion, as it turns those who possess it into becoming irrational romantics.\nThe film is a romantic comedy, with the trappings for a detective story thrown in for good measure, as murder somehow gets into the story, with the help of all the vulnerable and oddball characters who are involved in the romantic shenanigans going on. But the explicit sex is kept to the minimum; instead, it uses the need to find romance as a form of irony to point out the thin line that separates love from madness. The film is very brutal on psychoanalysts and their pet theories. It pretends to be supportive of philosophy and its intrinsic intellectual powers that society has very little value for, but does not move the film in that direction. Instead, it opts for light comedy.\nGregoire Moreau (Melvil Poupaud) is a philosophy student who looks a lot like the young Greenwich Village Bob Dylan looked ...his diabolical aim is to score girls, and the Diary is the perfect prop for him to do this. We pick up the tale, when he lays his trap for Claire (Chiara Mastroianni), a college student, who is undergoing psychoanalysis. All the characters in this story have some problem with understanding who they are and what are the boundaries for their behavior. So, even if the story tends to be implausible, it still makes sense in a nonsense sort of way, as Claire, soon after reading the Diary, drops the virginal and sexually ambivalent suitor Sebastien (Mathieu Amalric), who has somehow managed to move in with her and her single mother, Anne (Daniele), who happens to be a doctor. The chemistry is much better between Sebastien and Anne, a match that no one can possibly believe should be taking place, but is funny to watch as the opinionated and pushy Sebastien operates his inane charm on the sophisticated and attractive older woman, until she nearly makes a complete fool of herself. He does this without having read the Diary, but is working on his own diary, which Anne reads and is insulted but somewhat flattered by, reading the immaturity of his statements about her that he wrote in the diary, of how he would like to conquer her since her daughter has rejected him.\nHugo (Jean-Pierre Leaud) who seems to be reduced to playing small parts as weirdoes in recent films, I\&#39;m thinking of films like IRMA VEP, is smashing in his role as the former professor of Gregoire who has gone mad after reading the Diary, waxing on at a party about his love for the stand-offish Diane (Micheline), who is the agoraphobic, former actress grandmother of Gregoire. At his party, which he invited thirty guests, he manages only to lure Claire and a late arrival and two musicians playing music from India, who all leave after seeing how bizarre Hugo is, waving a gun, talking about suicide if he can\&#39;t have Diane, and ranting like a lunatic.\nThe main focus of the story is about the developing relationship between the nice girl Claire and the stealth, quiet-spoken Gregoire. Claire, dependent on her all-knowing shrink, Hubert (Hubert), for answers, naturally she tells him about the Diary, Gregoire, and the corpse she found in the refrigerator of his apartment. The shrink reads the Diary and falls madly in love with Claire, losing hold of himself and endangering his marriage, this is in contrast to his previously superior rational couch-side manner he had when doing a therapy session. He is now in need of a shrink, himself.\nWith all these characters and precarious situations abounding, the movie still had a flatness to it, though, admittedly, in some spots the craziness of the characters was hilarious. The flatness is derived from some spark that is missing from the film. As for me, I wasn\&#39;t taken with the main character, Gregoire, and therefore, had little interest in his strange love affair and his affixation with magic. The story itself was weakened by its not being developed further. It seemed to be thrown together as if it were a series of comedy skits. The film did have a good sense of tongue-in-cheek humor, keeping it lighthearted. But for a film about a book a great philosopher wrote, not to be thoughtful, is in my humble opinion, only an example of a filmmaker trying so hard to be devilish but succeeding only in becoming vulgar in a Philistine way.\nREVIEWED ON 2/21/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;THE TIME TO LIVE AND THE TIME TO DIE (director: Hou Hsiao hsien; cast: You Anshun (Ah-ha), Tien Feng, Mei Fang, Shufen Xin, Ann-Shuin Yiu, Tang Ruyun, Xiao Ai, Yu-Yuen Tang (Grandmother),1985-Tai.)\nAn autobiographical film of Hou Hsiao hsien, grounded in the history of Taiwan from 1947 through the 1950s and the early 1960s. This was a very demanding and taxing film for me to follow, not because of its slow pace and lack of action scenes, but because I didn\&#39;t have a full knowledge of what Taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame, therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events, didn\&#39;t always connect with me, as well as it should have. I could only watch the film from the point of view of what I got from the film itself. And, that is, the story of a family, trying to cope with their own secrets and their own idiosyncrasies, that proves to be a very human tale, something along the lines of an Ozu film.\nThe family leaves the mainland of China in 1947 and settles in Taiwan, where the father, who remains aloof from running the family business, leaving all that to his wife; as he concentrates on his job in a school. He gives his wife most of the salary and she uses it to take care of their big family, which includes the elderly grandmother. Ah-ha is the child who seems to miss having a father around the most. He is seen as being rebellious as a child, often disciplined by his mother. But he is also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around with the other children, enjoying a rich childhood, growing up with many pleasant memories. He is deeply loved by his grandmother, who tells him stories about the mainland and their ancestors, telling him her wish to return there, something he doesn\&#39;t follow, especially since he feels perfectly at home in Taiwan.\nWhen he becomes a teenager, he hangs around with a street gang. As a result he does not distinguish himself in school, until he realizes that he will have to pass the exams and choose a career, or else he will have a tough time surviving in Taiwan. He is also attracted to a girl who wants him to go to the university, which stimulates him further to pass the exams. His older sister is the more dominant one in the family, but we see him growing more and more loyal to the family, especially when his father dies, and then, when his mother dies, he is deeply shaken, showing the great love he had for her. The film is shot through the point of view of Ah-ha.\nWhat is beautiful about the film is its lushness, the sunny colors it evokes, giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise, and the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention to, like the softness of the rain falling, his father sitting so nobly by his desk, grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the family for what she is. When Ah-ha reads the letters of his mother and realizes that the father remained distant from the family because he had tuberculosis and was constantly sick, not wanting to contaminate the rest of the family, a condition that he didn\&#39;t tell his wife about before they were married, much to her displeasure, causing her to remark, later on, to the family, that health might be the only thing that is real, he begins to understand his father and the family he was brought up in, perhaps for the first time in his life. It is amusing to hear in the letters that he reads after his parents are dead, how his father made the family buy bamboo furniture because he always thought the move away from the mainland was a temporary one, and that someday they would go home again and it would be no problem discarding the cheap furniture.\nThis is a very subtle and wonderfully crafted film that depicts childhood in a very simple but relevant manner, that only a very few filmmakers have been able to do in such a sentimental but unsentimental way. This is a work of considerable merit.\nREVIEW ON 2/2/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;INNOCENTS WITH DIRTY HANDS (director: Claude Chabrol; cast: Romy Schneider (Julie Wormser), Rod Steiger (Louis Wormser), Paolo Giusti (Jeff Marle), Jean Rochefort (Maître Légal), François Maistre (Commissaire Lamy), Pierre Santini (Commissaire Villon), François Perrot (Georges Thorent), Hans-Christian Blech (Judge), 1975-France)\nGiven the context of the material for this pulp thriller, it is surprising that this English speaking Chabrol film, set in St. Tropez, is as diverting and suspenseful as it is. Credit must be given to an ingenious script, and acting kudos, especially for Romy, Jean, François, and Pierre, for making it possible for us to be fascinated with all the twists in the ever changing plot. The storyline starts off simply as a case of a boorish wealthy husband, Louis (Steiger), and his attractive younger wife, Julie (Romy), having a bit of a row in front of Julie\&#39;s new acquaintance, her handsome neighbor Jeff (Paolo), who introduces himself as being a hack writer. Louis drunkenly asks his wife in front of Jeff, &#34;Why don\&#39;t we ever make love ?&#34; The obvious affair between Julie and Jeff begins as soon as Louis retires for the night, and with Chabrol you know that is just the beginning of more mysterious things to ensue.\nChabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before, to belittle the bourgeois lifestyle, to question why sex is the most important thing in a relationship, and how money is such a psychological part of one\&#39;s mindset. This is all done, as the cheating couple decides to kill Louis and dump his body in the sea, so that he will never be found and Julie can inherit everything, and when things quiet down they will get back together.\nA visiting Paris police inspector and his friend, the local police inspector take an interest in the case, suspecting foul play, never convinced of Julie\&#39;s story that her husband is missing. They come to the conclusion, after much spirited conversation about the case over some hearty meals and good liquor, that she is having an affair with Jeff, as important clues pop up, like her missing earring in Jeff\&#39;s apartment, an envelope addressed to Jeff, postmarked after her husband was reported missing, that is found in the front seat of a crashed car over the side of the seacoast, a car that Julie told the police her husband loaned Jeff, and then there is the information they gathered from Louis\&#39;s doctor, that Louis made up the story of having a heart condition because he was ashamed of his impotency and wanted Julie to think that he couldn\&#39;t perform because of his bad heart. The gut feeling of the police is that Julie and her boyfriend killed Louis and dumped his body out to sea. But Julie\&#39;s lawyer, Mr. Légal (Rochefort), you just can\&#39;t top that for a lawyer\&#39;s name, as he goes about his lawyer\&#39;s business in an abrasive and madly befitting way, using logic and the command of his wit to the nth degree to get his client cleared of all the circumstantial charges. Mr. Légal is a pip, a pleasure to see on screen; a character nonpareil, played to perfection, someone who, despite his small part, you will remember long after seeing the film.\nJust when you think you think you got what is happening, the twists keep coming, like Louis coming back to Julie, getting sex from her on the expensive carpet, just like she gave it to Jeff, telling her he\&#39;s a new man because of them (Too bad they didn\&#39;t have Viagra then). A little Freudian transference is thrown into the stew, as Louis goes on to boast how he outfoxed the couple, staying sober one night to spy on them, aware of their love making and plans to do him in, he thereby, jumps Jeff first, throwing him into the deep blue sea. But if you think you got where the story is going now, you better get ready for a few more curve balls thrown your way, because Chabrol is going to town with this thriller, twisting and turning at the movement of every Julie sexy wiggle.\nThe outcome is a satisfying one, though if you start to think of what occurred, of relationships changing every reel, of those dead, not being dead, you might have some doubts about the possibilities of pulling off all the switches. But by having the police using their power of deduction to amusingly follow the trail as closely and as delightfully as they can, it all adds punch to the pulp story, so even if you are aware that there are a few turn of events that might stretch the imagination a little too much, that maybe the story did get a little too cute, as there are too many places where you can cast doubt that the story would hold up to further scrutiny; nevertheless, it is more fun to let the story pass as it is, and enjoy it for what it is, as Jeff turns up alive, and the situation must get resolved again, as Julie is now in a position to choose between the new Louis, now able to service her properly, and the dashingly irresistible Jeff.\nWhat an enjoyable film this is ! So much is thrown into the mix, if you don\&#39;t like one twist in the story there is another to soon come, as the cold-hearted bitchy sexpot Julie becomes more important to the men than the money or their state of well-being. Chabrol even gives the justice system a well-deserved scolding, saying the reason for the vagaries in justice existing as it does for women, is because the law was created by men for men. The film begins in irony and ends in irony, even though everything about the characters involved has changed. Even the police seem a little smarter for their effort.\nREVIEWED ON 4/1/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;TANGO (director:Carlos Saura; cast: Miguel Angel Sola (Mario Suarez), Cecilia Narova (Laura Fuentes), Mia Maestro (Elena Flores) Juan Carlos Copes (Carlos Nebbia), Carlos Rivarola (Ernesto Landi), Julio Bocca (as himself), Juan Luis Galiardo (Angelo Larroca), 1998-Argentinia/Spain)\nTango is a romantic musical, supposedly influenced by Fellini\&#39;s 8 1/2, with political overtones to its otherwise almost mirthful mood, that is, for a Saura film. He brings back memories of the generals of 1976 Argentina and their overthrow of the legitimate government, emphasizing in one skit, how so many people just disappeared during that regime, by showing bodies thrown into a mass grave, giving the film a jolt of terrifying and evocative fear, that brings about an abrupt but temporary shift of mood. Saura accomplishes his musical numbers with a rather terse storyline, which means that if you don\&#39;t care for the tango, you could find yourself bored with this slow-moving story. What is exceptional about this film, is how superbly choreographed and stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is, as its cinematographer is the great Vittorio Storaro (LAST TANGO IN PARIS). Saura captures the passion of the tango, using Mario (Sola) as his alter-ego to hold his story together. One of the tango masters, explains to us that the tango is excellently done when experienced dancers can perform it, so there is one body and four legs in motion.\nMario is in his opulently decorated apartment, recovering from a broken leg in a car accident, as the film opens, despondent that his wife Laura (Cecilia) has left him for another man, presumably a younger man (as far as I could tell, Mario must be somewhere in his forties). He is busy at his desk preparing a film that he is directing about the history of Argentina, starting at the turn of the century. In his vivid imagination, he intercuts what is currently happening to him with how he saw things as a child and with what the film he is directing will be about. All this imagining leaves the audience trying to figure out what is real and what is illusionary, as the story revolves around his tremendous passion for the tango and his need to be with a woman who shares his zest for life, as he wonders if his life has been meaningful.\nHe meets a 23-year-old novice dancer, through a gangster, Angelo (Galiardo), who happens to be her live-in boyfriend, and as the main backer of the film, he requests Mario try her out for a part in the film. He falls in love with her, and is concerned but not relenting, when she tells him that if she leaves Angelo, he threatened to do harm to her. With Elena in the picture, he seems to be over carrying the torch for his ex-wife.\nThere is lots of innovative dancing and, by Mario, there is lots of deep brooding thought about life and what must go into the film to make it arty. We see see a wind machine and the next thing we see is a sultry tango being performed, sets are designed out of seemingly thin air, there are color filters for dance numbers created on the spot, a WEST SIDE STORY look alike number is shown with all male dancers.\nThe dancing is good enough to carry this film alone. The tango is danced with passion by everyone, especially graceful were the two women stars and the great tango dancer Julio Bocca. But the story, that\&#39;s another story, it just didn\&#39;t seem that important, including the nebulous surprise ending, which in actuality, detracted even further from the slight storyline. The only scene of dialogue that I thought was really well-done, was when Mario was on a dinner date with Elena and was trying to explain and sell himself to her, telling her how he thought like a young man. He was eventually able to do this, by just being himself, after trying to use a few far-fetched analogies, comparing men to women, that didn\&#39;t seem to go over with her.\nThe mood the musical numbers set was so convincingly dreamlike, that for someone like me, who was born with two left feet, I felt like going to a ballroom and trying this elegant dance, even if I never danced the tango before.The dancing remains in my head, and that is what cinema can do to you when it is so stunning to behold.\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;WHEN TRUMPETS FADE (director: John Irving; cast: Ron Eldard (Manning), Zak Orth (Sanderson), Martin Donovan (Capt. Roy Pritchett), Dylan Bruno (Sgt. Talbot), Dwight Yoakam (Lt. Colonel), Frank Whaley (Chamberlain), Timothy Olyphant (Lt. Lukas), Dan Futterman (Despin), 1998)\nThis is a gritty, workman-like WW11 HBO made for TV movie, that is much better, surprisingly, than most of those kind of movies usually are, taking place in a battlefield in the Hurtgen Forest, 1944, on the border of Belgium and Germany, though it was shot in Hungary. This battle was a precursor to the Battle of the Bulge, and is not as well known, but 24,000 U.S. troops did lose their lives there in bloody combat. The film is seen through the eyes of Pvt. Manning (Ron), whose main purpose in battle is to stay alive. In a year when two epic war films were made, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE THIN RED LINE, this low budget movie holds its own with those films storywise, only lacking the great cinematography of those films, but its cinematography was realistic enough, aiding in the clarity of telling the story, that is highlighted by an engaging characterization by Ron Eldard and the other soldiers who look as if they are really WW11 soldiers. Eldard\&#39;s quiet toughness and demeanor seems to fit his role as a non-conformist soldier, even though Manning is not exactly a hero, but more of a man who is wrestling with his conscience, thrust into a situation he didn\&#39;t relish, due to unforeseen circumstances and clever manuevering by his superior officers, a role in which he comes through in the end with flying colors, ironically getting killed in action, in the end, because of his reward for previously surviving. Now this has been tried in many of the older WW11 films, but for the most part, it didn\&#39;t work because the acting was not as convincing as these unheralded actors are.\nWe first see Manning in action trying to carry one of the badly wounded survivors from his squad back to his company area, but is resisted by the soldier, who is scared out of his mind. Manning is forced to shoot him, rather than leave him behind in pain, with no chance of being rescued. Upon his return to his company, his commander, Captain Pritchett (Donovan), has the task of telling him he is the sole survivor, and to his regret, even if he doesn\&#39;t fully trust Manning, he, at least, recognizes that he has an innate battle sense, which is why he chooses to make him a sergeant; it will be his job to lead the new replacements into the next battle, which is part of the big push toward Germany. The heart of the movie revolves around the credibility of the human drama involving how Manning is forced to take this responsible position, even as he tries to talk the captain out of it, knowing full well that he will now have to look out not only for himself but for others, when his ability to survive before, just depended on how he looked out for himself, which he proved that he was quite capable of doing. In such a short time, we feel that we know Manning and know what he will do, and that his tough mental attitude seems more realistic than many of the other soldiers we see with a proper military attitude. It is hard to say for sure if we can like a person such as Manning, but even as we question his motives, whether or not they are selfish, we still respect him as a man who will not blindly follow orders, even if he has to be insubordinate. This fuzziness about his character holds our interest throughout the film.\nThe replacement soldiers have no clue of what they are getting into, having no battle experience, as they are now unfairly thrust into the middle of some of the fiercest fighting taking place. One of the new soldiers, Warren (Zak), is perfecto for this part. When on his first tour in a foxhole, he asks the person he relieves of duty the most sensible question he can ask, &#34;What am I supposed to do here?&#34; The logic of that question and the inexperience of his new sergeant in telling him what to do on watch, and the natural snafus that are part of the army, all come into play in the consternation written all over Warren\&#39;s chubby bespectacled, purely innocent American face, stuck in a war whose ideology sounds good in the text books and newspapers back home, but has a strange way of losing force in a foxhole.Warren was undoubtedly picked on by Manning for this detail, because of his nerdy physical appearance and his inability to hide his greenness and fear. Be that as it may, Warren grows up rapidly and handles himself with dignity, and becomes the sole survivor, as he becomes Manning\&#39;s heir apparent.\nThere is some kind of friction between the field officers and the regular soldiers, the ones who bear the brunt of the war and who are asked to die for their country, if need be. Dwight Yoakam plays the Lt. Colonel, who is acting the part of the hard-nosed, uncaring leader, sending men into battles where there is little chance of them returning in one piece. Thusly, he orders Capt. Pritchett to take a bridge the Germans have heavy firepower on. Here the story gets a little incredulous, as no squad volunteers for that detail, the captain tells Manning he will give him a section 8 discharge if he volunteers for the job. Manning had previously asked for that but it was denied him, but here it sounds phony that Manning would accept, but he does, putting his new replacements in a danger they really shouldn\&#39;t have been in just for his selfish interest. Everyone in the squad gets killed but Manning and Warren, but the bridge is temporarily secured by the combat instincts of Manning. A few things then happen, as this tightly drawn tale begins to weaken into a predictable ending, as Lt. Lukas (Olyphant) has a nervous break down after seeing all the casualties, and the Lt. Colonel orders Manning to take his place and be a lieutenant; again, this is done against Manning\&#39;s wishes. Also, a Sgt. Talbot (Bruno), who resents Manning\&#39;s unwillingness to be a team player, accuses him of abandoning his green troops and coming back again without a full squad.\nEach of the recent war films I have seen has its own grit and dirt to it, as they seemed to be made nowadays with a new determination to be more realistic and less all apple pie than ever before, as most of the pre-Vietnam War films were. I welcome this kind of realistic filmmaking, and since war never seems to go out of style, it is worthwhile seeing how young men fight in such wars, maybe some day all sides will figure out that there is a better way to settle things. Until then, there is nothing like a good war film to bring the war into our homes and consciousness, and this one is a reasonably good one.\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;SONATINE (director: Takeshi Kitano; cast: &#34;Beat&#34; Takeshi Kitano (Murakama), Tetsu Watanabe (Uechi), Aya Kokumai (Miyuki), Masanobu Katsumura (Ryoji), Susumu Terashima (Ken), Ren Ohsugi (Katagiri), Tonbo Zushi (Kitajima), Kenichi Yajima (Takahashi) and Eiji Minakata (the Hit Man), 1993-Jap.)\nKitano, the director and star of this gangster actioner, has created a visually stunning, original and spellbinding depiction of stylized gang fights, ambushes, and assorted mayhem. Kitano the actor, keeps an impassive facial expression throughout the movie, as he toys with his guns at play and for real, in a performance that wavers between a sensibility and an insensibility toward life, as violence though not glorified, nevertheless is what is fascinatingly portrayed by his unwillingness, in the end, to be perceived any other way.\nThe great images on screen is the star of this film, not the acting, nor the story line, both pale next to the splendid visualizations Kitano creates. Kitano was a popular television stand-up comedian in Japan, among his many other artistic endeavors, before he embarked on a critically successful but commercially disappointing new movie career, which started in 1989. The Japanese audiences rebuked him for his critique of their social conformity; and, thusly, his movie appeal is mostly with foreign audiences.\nKitano is the weary hit-man whose boss implores him, against his wishes, to leave his turf in Tokyo and go with his men to Okinawa to settle a dispute between rival gangs. After some of his men are ambushed in a restaurant, he realizes he has been set-up, so he takes the remainder of his gang to hide in a remote beach house. Here the film gets playful and unpredictable, as Kitano has his men shed their tough guy personas and play like the children they really are. The games are imaginative and brilliantly filmed, as the men do sumo wrestling rituals and shoot off fireworks as they play war games amongst themselves. The narrative fades in importance, and the sheer poetry of the moment is caught on screen, giving us the impression that this is the first time in a long while he is enjoying being who he is. He even has a woman there who admires him for being such a tough guy, only he tells her, in essence, he is only a tough guy because he is scared.\nIn one scene, he passively watches a rape take place on the beach, and when the rapist spots him and ironically calls him a pervert and puts a knife to his throat, Kitano casually kills him, but not before the rapist mutters, &#34;what is this, some kind of dirty joke.&#34;\nYou can blindly fall in love with a film like this for its originality and forcefulness, as it allows you to look at brutality without having to offer the usual rational responses for its place in the film. The last reel of the film is somewhat of a meditation on death and suicide. It brings up all kinds of hidden emotions in Kitano, and is miles apart from any other type of film of this particular genre. By taking the time needed to explore the inner workings of his character, Kitano has taken the gangster role and made it more intellectually spicy than it usually is for such violent films. For Kitano, life and death both have a fond place in his heart. And, even though, there is shown a lot of the usual reactions gangsters have when they are double-crossed, such as revenge, the film somehow is trying to say more than that, but what that is, is hard to say, because it is the visual effects that are what splendidly override everything else about this film, as there are moments of gore interrupted by welcomed moments of dreamlike serenity, all done with magical camera work, probably, hiding the fact, that the film had nothing really to say other than the pretty picture it paints on screen, since whenever it had a chance to say something, Kitano was mute. But it was done so stylishly well, that it was, indeed, intriguing to behold, leaving the viewer with much doubt about who Kitano really is supposed to be, aside from his hubris as a gangster, and, his mixed outbursts of violent outward behavior and contemplative inner mood swings.\nREVIEWED ON 8/16/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;L.A. CONFIDENTIAL ( director: Curtis Hanson; cast: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, 1997)\nA 1950s history of sleazy Hollywood and corrupt cops and crime bosses running the city, is gone over with a fine eye for detail in this stylized, technicolor noir film, that also depicts the popular scandal magazine of that era, Confidential Magazine, (but called in the movie, Hush-Hush). This film will evoke memories of films such as CHINATOWN and THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, and of the starlets of that era, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake, and Rita Hayworth. The feel of the movie is of nostalgia for the Hollywood glamorous life of that period, at least it presents what we are led to believe is glamorous, while the paparazzi click their cameras at the action and work hand-in-hand with the cops, hoping to catch a Hollywood figure with narcotics, or in bed with someone who they shouldn\&#39;t be with, or get the goods on some commies in Hollywood. Crime and violence and corruption run amok in the city, but the police use the media to project their police department as the best in the country.\nThere are so many wonderful performances, that it is difficult to say which one is the best, but the Russell Crowe, dumb tough guy, muscle man cop, takes the cake as far as I am concerned, it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across, as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing, as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information. He is a regular Mr. Softee for woman, and is particularly rough on woman beaters, as he explains how he was influenced to become a cop, thinking he could do some good for society, after watching his dad beat on his mom. Kim is the whore, made to look like Veronica Lake, working for a millionaire (Strathairn) who sets her up with Johns, who like doing it with some one who resembles a famous star. She falls for Crowe. And believe it or not, these are the two most virtuous ones in this flick.\nThe main plot of the film involves a stick-up in a diner called the Night Owl, where six people are slain, including an ex-cop. It soon becomes apparent, after the arrest and shooting of the three Negroes framed for the job, that something big is happening here, and it is more than the ordinary crime it first appeared to be. The politically opportunist Pearce, uses this opportunity to become a hero, first arresting the Negroes, then shooting them when they escape. He gets his promotion to homicide lieutenant, and stiffly grins through his clenched shiny teeth. He is hated by the men in the department for breaking the cops &#34;code of silence.&#34; But he doesn\&#39;t care, he is both ambitious and eager to do his job the right way. He wants to emulate his dad who was a hero detective, killed in the line of duty.\nKevin Spacey plays Jack Vincennes as smoothly as he can, a role he plays with great relish, interested in the glamor of the job, he is the technical advisor to the detective TV series, Badge of Honor, which is a take-off on the real TV show of the 50s, Dragnet. He works secretly with the sleazy DeVito character, who is the edgy journalist of Hush-Hush magazine. Spacey gets money from Devito and credits for the arrests and DeVito scoops the other publications with these hot pictures and stories.\nCromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief, with a heavy Irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop, who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you. His role in the film is crucial for our understanding of the underlying sentiment of how the L.A. police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry, even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation.\nThe film is long, but it moves at a very brisk pace, covering a multitude of sub-plots. The most disturbing thing about the movie, might not be that disturbing if you believe that justice doesn\&#39;t work, anyway, and that if the criminal element gets pounded on, then, so what, they are only criminals who would be getting away with crime completely if not for these rogue cops. The would be lesson to be learned from this film, is that the only thing that works in uncovering the misdeeds in this city of secret deals and corruption, is the ability of strong arming the suspects and gangsters you need info from. The conflict of being a cop in this town, is over what one wants his job to be like and why one joined the force in the first place, this is answered differently by the three lead cops: Pearce (the new kind of media image cop, is out for himself), Crowe (the old-style of cop, we don\&#39;t talk to outsiders type), and Spacey (who has forgotten why he joined the force). What was made to seem impossible, was a cop who is good at his job and gets promoted legitimately without political influence and is honest.\nMaybe the filmmakers are right in their slick attitude, or maybe this film is just pure entertainment. But the film loaded the deck for any other argument, and that is what deters me from going overboard and praising this film to the heavens, even if it is an exceptionally well-made, cynically humorous, and terrifically acted picture; but, yet, it might not be as great as it appears, since its subliminal message is that you can\&#39;t change the system.\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;UNDERGROUND (director: Emir Kusturica; Miki Manojlovic, Lazar Ristovski, Mirjana Jokovic, 1995-Fr./Ger./Hun.)\nThis rambling, marathon of an epic movie, aspiring for greatness in filmmaking but in reality is a real snoozer, erupting for a few electrifying scenes, and going on for what seemed an eternity, to tell the 50 years of Yugoslavian history by dividing it into 3 parts: the German invasion in 1941, the cold war-Tito socialist state period, and the ethnic cleansing and war period in 1991.\nThe best scenes are the ones that featured the brass band, used from the opening invasion scene, where we see the band march raucously over the ruined landscape, for no particular reason, and then is used intermittingly throughout the film. It woke me from my snooze each time, and gave life to a film that needed resuscitation. A film that tried desperately to find humor in its madcap antics and absurd characterization of individuals, which I understand to be political jibes, but I still found them to be made in a heavy handed manner and were not funny.\nThe first part of the film is devoted to the friendship of two formidable con men, who each vie to out con the other. These parts are played by two fine actors; Miki, who is the Communist intellectual and later corrupt gun runner; and, Lazar, who is the adventurer and risk taker. They both seduce the sexually active Mirjana, who plays an actress caught up in the wars and politics of the times that she doesn\&#39;t want to understand. The most memorable scene here, is the zoo being bombed by the Nazis and the animals running free, which is example of another too obvious piece of symbolism.\nPart 2 is where Miki outcons his friend Lazar, and keeps him and his group locked up in a secure cellar, not telling them the war has ended a long time ago. Miki rises in power in the Tito peace-time government, and grows rich by selling weapons. All the deceptions and hypocrisies of the leaders are reiterated over and over, along with the filmmaker\&#39;s yearning for a unified country, this is done an unnecessary amount of times, until it becomes annoying to see every image as a symbol of the same theme.\nThe most absurd scene from part 2 is reserved for when a movie is being made for the dead national hero Lazar and the living hero, comrade Miki; and Lazar reappears, as the movie is being made.\nPart 3 recaps the latest tragedy, there is no more Yugoslavia of Tito\&#39;s era, brother is killing brother. The U.N. is severely blamed for its inability to be useful in stopping the war.\nWhat saved this film from bombing out completely, was the excellent technical skills of the director and the robust performances from the two male leads, and because this part of the world is in the news again with its problems that draws us into their civil wars, having started the century with its ethnic conflicts and will end the century with its problems still not resolved. Other than that, I couldn\&#39;t wait for the film to end.\nREVIEWED ON 10/7/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;TITANIC (director: James Cameron; cast: Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson), Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater), Gloria Stuart (Rose Dawson Calvert), Billy Zane (Cal Hockley), Kathy Bates (Molly Brown), Frances Fisher (Ruth DeWitt Bukater), Bernard Hill (Capt. E.J. Smith), Victor Garber (Thomas Andrews), Bill Paxton (Brock Lovett), David Warner (law officer), 1997)\nAn unconscionable clinker for those who are more impressed with intellect in films than with special effects, for a film costing 200 million dollars to make, while doing a dutiful job in recreating the grandeur of the ship and its ritzy atmosphere, but failing in everything else, except in the gall to think it has created a masterpiece. If there is anyone out there who stills believes there is such a thing as an unsinkable ship, you\&#39;ll believe Leonardo DiCaprio\&#39;s innocuous portrayal of an artist on board the ill-fated ship and that the soap opera story told is tantamount to a work of art. This epic disaster film of the Titanic\&#39;s sinking upon hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912, is all gloss, high-class trash, something that is so opulently Hollywood, so much so that it deserved to win an Oscar and set box office records for the audacity to perceive itself as the official version of what happened to the Titanic, while even in its quest for accuracy, it still does not play up the fact that a near-by ship refused to come in time to save those who were in the water freezing to death, thereby causing the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of the 1500 hundred that were found to be dead out of the two thousand and two hundred passengers on board. Films backed by big money like this one, rarely ever go after controversy, much preferring to steer a trouble-free course, with a clever eye to the bottom line.\nThis three hour and eleven minute disaster film opens with a team of deep sea explorers, led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton), looking for the Titanic\&#39;s treasures and the valuable jewels it had on board. These slick treasure hunters are disappointed that their found booty has turned to mud and that the only thing they have come up with, is a nude picture of a woman with the world\&#39;s most valuable blue egg-shaped diamond necklace (Le Coeur de la Mer) around her neck. But to their surprise, they receive a call from the lady who posed for that picture, who is now a 101 years-old. And the film begins its flashback of what happened to the Titanic, narrated through the eyes of Rose (Gloria), who in real-life, is an 87-year-old former actress who appeared in the Gold Diggers of 1935.\nImmediately we see this is going to be a class war struggle piece, with the haughty rich boarding on first class passage and the lower-class in steerage, and they are shown to be living their lives in starkly different worlds. The first one we see to board from first class, is the gorgeous and well- plumed Rose (Kate), with her snooty mother (Francis), and the man she is soon to be married to, the wealthy scion to his families business, Cal, but the catch is that she can\&#39;t stand him, as he is played hideously and one-dimensionally by Zane. By way of steerage comes our boy Jack Dawson (Leonard), who wins his ticket in a card game. All the lower-class people are the salts of the earth, while all the upper-class people are snobs. There is one exception, &#34;The Unsinkable Molly Brown,&#34; who represented the class of &#34;new money,&#34; she is played without creating any further interest in her character, by Kathy Bates, who seems to be going through the motions of what the character is like. I think any actress on board that ship could have played that part. It is hard to believe how trite and contrived this story was, and how everyone in this film had no depth of character. Everyone was a wooden stereotype of what their class status was supposed to be like. What gave this film watch ability, was the way the ship was recreated down to its last details, giving one the romantic feeling that one was on the real voyage. At least, the money spent for visual effects went to some good usage.\nThe love story begins when Jack stops Rose from jumping overboard, as she is apparently confused about her situation and contemplates suicide. The remainder of the film is about these star-crossed lovers, trying to get together but being opposed by her mother and her future husband, who acts in a pompous manner, becoming the ready made villain of this story, never changing his intonations for one moment.\nThe other part of the film focuses on the ship\&#39;s management telling the captain to speed things up, and the intrepid captain against his better judgment is obliging to that wish, supposedly for the publicity the ship would get if it docked in New York ahead of schedule. What was ultimately unforeseen, was that the weather created conditions that made it impossible to detect icebergs, which the ship rammed into at full speed.\nThe photography was great. The costumes were terrific. The sound system was as good as it gets. Everything about the special effects was first-class. If you judge a film by those standards, then you will be more than pleased with this film. If you are looking for a cruise into deeper water, then I\&#39;m afraid you boarded the wrong film, this one will only leak all over you. I waited a long time to see this film, choosing to watch it on TV and not on a big screen theater; I have no regrets why I waited so long. By the way, I saw A NIGHT TO REMEMBER (1958), and thought that version of the Titanic to be just grand, not cluttered with a trivial story, just sticking to the suspense of the historical event, which was fine and dandy by my non technical cerebral standards.\nREVIEWED ON 4/11/99\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;SWEET HEREAFTER, THE (director: Atom Egoyan; cast: Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, Bruce Greenwood, Tom McCamus, Gabrielle Rose, Alberta Watson, Arsinee Khanjian, Earl Pastko, Maury Chaykin, Caerthan Banks, 1997-Can.)\nA flawlessly made film, magnificently acted, with beautiful cinematography to go with a compelling story, about a school bus accident resulting in the death and injury to all the 14 children on board the bus, that tears the heart out of an isolated small-town in British Columbia, a story that is very difficult to cover in all the implications it has for the families and ambulance chasing, big-city lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian) involved, yet it does do just that, as adapted from a Russell Banks novel and brought to screen not only intact but with a certain forcefulness that reflects the director&#39;s ability to dig deeply into the story and make it both accessible and innovatively chilling.\n&gt;From the opening scene, where Ian receives a call on his cell phone while in a car wash, from his daughter Zoe (Caerthan), who is a druggie, in and out of drug clinics for the past 10 years, and a disappointment to Ian and his separated wife; she hates them both equally as she once loved them both equally as a child. She will call him at all hours, and their conversations are regrettably filled with rancor, though they never stop the relationship completely, even though there is no hope for it. Something went terribly wrong and either party doesn&#39;t know what else to do. One of the most touching and memorable scenes of the film, is the distraught Ian telling a school chum of Zoe, while on board a plane to meet Zoe, how she was bitten by a baby spider when she was 3, and how he rushed her to a hospital 40 miles away, prepared to do anything to save her, even operate on her in the car with a pen knife, if necessary.\nThe film does not move along in a linear timeline, so it is constantly going back and forth, from events leading up to the accident, to the perplexed guilt and anger that permeates Ian&#39;s thoughts about his failed relationship with Zoe. So when Ian arrives at his first potential client&#39;s place, which is a motel owned by Alberta and Maury, we already know much about the accident and why Ian is there, and we quickly learn from the couple all the foibles and gossip about the other potential lawsuit clients Ian hopes to represent, such as the going-ons of incest and thievery among his potential clients. Later on, we learn that the likable good guy of the story, Billy (Bruce) is having an affair with Alberta.\nIan is very intense, almost over the edge, but he makes sense to these victims, and he requires no payment if he loses the case, but will be getting 1/3 of the settlement if he wins. He is able to convince many of the others involved to retain him (the others, apparently, get another lawyer), even though there is really no one to blame for the accident, it was simply the case of Dolores (Gabrielle), the very able driver of the bus, driving slowly but still hitting an icy spot on the road and the bus going over the guard rail on the side of the mountain and sinking in the soft ice below. Ian&#39;s argument is that there are no such things as accidents, someone must be blamed; and if it is not the driver, then it could be the bus company that might be apt to cut corners on safety. The important thing, is that they need compensation for their grief and anger, since their children can&#39;t be brought back to life, then money will have to do. And this we learn, also applies to himself, as he considers himself a victim just as much as they are, which is why he thinks that he can easily identify with these parents and their grief; he has told himself that his daughter is already dead, and he thinks this is the way he is to get compensated for his grief.\nIn case you didn&#39;t get the thrust of the story from that angle, the theme of the story is again presented as Nicole (Sarah), the baby sitter to Billy&#39;s kids, reads them a Robert Browning nursery poem, The Pied Piper, the night before the accident. He&#39;s the one who killed all the rats in town, and when the town refused to pay him, he led all the children in town away, except the one who was too lame to follow, into a magical place where everything was strange and new... Nicole survives the accident but is crippled, ruining her chances of being a rock and roller, while the kids she baby sat for, die... Billy&#39;s habit was to follow the bus to school, he loved his kids so much, and with his wife&#39;s death, he loved to wave to them as he drove behind them and they would wave back to him from the back of the bus. Thereby, he witnessed the accident, and felt drained from it, especially when he was unable to help as he saw his kids die.\nNicole&#39;s parents zealously back the law suit, to the regret of Billy and Nicole. Billy vehemently states that this will split the town apart forever, that there was no one to blame for it, let it be. Nicole&#39;s reasons are more nefarious (it seems ironic that the theme of the poem she read to Billy&#39;s kids, will the next day mirror her situation), and since she has a poker face, she surprises her seemingly loving parents and startled lawyer by lying at the deposition.\nThis all adds up to a brilliant film. One of the best of the recent lawyer genre films now being made (it is the best one I have seen), and the only reason it is not a masterpiece, in my opinion, is because it was too real, something metaphorical about it was lacking; I went away from the film intellectually gratified, but did not feel the film opened up the emotional wounds of the locals whereas they would see anything more about the tragedy than the fact that their lives had been changed; even if, some of the locals now question their motives to retain a lawyer, and that is now questioned in a way that it has never been questioned before. I have no problem with that aspect of the film, that was convincingly conveyed to me; as was, the lawyer&#39;s motives, who comes across to us as not a good or an evil man, he is a man driven and ripped apart by guilt, even to the point of exhibiting bizarre behavior, as he searches to find a meaning for his life that he doesn&#39;t quite understand anymore, which is apparently more true than his belief that he is so committed to his work because he is trying to find justice for his clients; so what we have, what remains for us to ponder, is the fact that nothing is as simple as the accident is; everyone&#39;s life has been changed and nothing is the same anymore. But the question that still remains, is what has anyone learned from this, and that is left lingering because there is an emotional disconnect inbred in the story, when all is said and done, and we don&#39;t know for sure if anything was learned. Nevertheless, Atom Egoyan has created a splendid artistic film. He should be acknowledged by now, as one of our greatest living filmmakers.\nREVIEWED ON 10/13/98\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;OPPOSITE OF SEX, THE (director: Don Roos; cast: Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Lyle Lovett, Ivan Sergei, Johnny Galecki, William Scott Lee, 1998)\nRoos\&#39;s first feature film as director, is a snappy, satirical and hip sitcom that is not a sitcom, but is a semi-comedy. It stars Ricci, as a bitchy 16-year-old, without any noticeable positive qualities, who begins the film by warning those who don\&#39;t like her voice-overs, they will be out of luck. She narrates by filling in all the gaps in the story, emphasizing her point of view.\nRicci has run away from the Louisiana mother she despises after her step-father dies, and she chooses to live with her half-brother (Donovan), who is gay and lives with his lover (Ivan). Donovan\&#39;s true love has died of AIDS and he has inherited his lover\&#39;s wealthy home. Ricci proceeds to steal Ivan from Donovan by seducing him and telling him that she is pregnant with his child. Ivan even states, that he is now a bisexual not a homosexual. She runs away with Ivan and steals 10,000 dollars from Donovan, plus the ashes from his deceased lover.\nLisa is the embittered, acid tongued, single sister of Donovan\&#39;s dead lover. She works as a teacher in the same school as Donovan. In fact, she has a crush on him but to her dismay she introduced him to her brother.\nLovette is the low-key sheriff who woos Lucia. Galecki is the comically, body-pierced gay, former student at the high school Donovan teaches at, who falsely accuses him of making sexual advances. But he really pines for Ivan. Lee is the crazed Christian fundamentalist, who was born with one testicle, and is Ricci\&#39;s lover and the real father of the child.\nThis film tells you how smart it thinks it is - that it is so cleverly written, that it can say anything about anyone and get away with it. What remained constantly grating throughout the film, was Ricci\&#39;s snide voice-over comments that were politically incorrect: insulting gays and holding a negative view of sex. She dresses in tartish, campy outfits, and is always smoking a cigarette, adding to the film\&#39;s theme of being opposite to what is expected of a teen. Ricci succeeds in her role of getting the audience to dislike her. But when you contrast the personalities of the men compared to the women, the men leads are bland and affable, while the women all have verve and fuller depth to their characters.\nHow one rates this film, depends on what one is looking for. If it is laughs one is after, there are plenty of them. If it is a well-developed film, not a one -gag movie, then one might be disappointed in the film, as it tended to make one grow weary of its plot and put off by its overly clever voice-over. If it is acting one is looking for, then one can appreciate Lisa\&#39;s role, as she finds it within herself to convey in an honest way how an intelligent but frightened and lonely woman behaves. If one is looking for some deep meaning, then one will be pleased by Lovett\&#39;s reflective statement to lisa, &#34;that sex isn\&#39;t just for recreation or procreation, but for concentration - that when making love, the experience allows one to relate wholly with someone else so that one can forget their loneliness.&#34; Lovett goes on to say, &#34;if his lover walks into a crowded room, he is the one he wants her to notice.&#34;\nFor me, the film was a mixed bag of emotions. Since I am not partial to sitcom style movies, no matter how conventional or unconvential they may seem to be, I found myself swaying back and forth, liking some parts of the film and resenting other parts, and just like everything about the film, I was ultimately left in a paradoxical mood.\nREVIEWED ON 10/12/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34; OZUS Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;CARLA&#39;S SONG (director: Ken Loach; cast: Robert Carlyle (George), Oyanka Cabezas (Carla), Subash Sing Pall (Victor), Stewart Preston (McGurk), Gary Lewis (Sammy), Scott Glenn (Bradley), Margaret McAdam (George&#39;s Mother), 1996-UK)\nIt is difficult to know what to believe is right and wrong about this Ken Loach politico/romance film, that is guaranteed to never completely satisfy one politically or romantically, as it takes the ruling government&#39;s Sandinista&#39;s side (left wing) over the CIA supported Contra (right wing) guerrilla&#39;s side in the Nicaraguan War in 1987, and it does this as seen through the romance between an emotionally unbalanced Glasgow bus driver, George (Carlyle), who falls for a destitute and friendless Nicaraguan refugee to his country, Carla (Oyanka Cabezas). Their romance is believable as long as the story remained in Scotland.\nIf loach stayed in Scotland with the story, as he does in the first half of this film, and not transport it to Nicaragua, then we might have gotten somewhere with this unlikely romance between the politically unaware and insubordinate bus driver and his unpaying passenger, whose romance starts out when an inspector gets on his bus and challenges her for a ticket, as George comes to her aid and is given a week&#39;s suspension for his rudeness to the inspector. By chasing after the hard to get to know Carla, he discovers that she has troubling secrets about her past that she refuses to talk about.These dark secrets are about her lover she left behind, who was an activist in the Sandinista movement. The problem is so serious, that she has twice attempted suicide in Glasgow.\nGeorge takes a double-decker bus for a joy ride outside of Glasgow to show his girlfriend the natural beauty of the Scottish lochs and mountain sides he loved as a boy. This action will result in his dismissal from being a bus driver. He then impulsively makes up his mind to take her back to her country so she can resolve what is troubling her. Once in Nicaragua he is troubled by all the killing going on around him. The film turns into an expose of how terrible the CIA is for backing the vicious animals who make up the Contras. Bradley (Campbell) has the flat role of being the shill for screenwriter Paul Laverty&#39;s liberal pronouncements about the war, as Bradley is a former CIA operative in Nicaragua, who has now become a pacifist working for a human rights organization. This is all trite and, for me, unlikely stuff. The romance is put on hold till we find out what happened to Carla&#39;s lover. Therefore the animated George of the first half of the film, is reduced to being a passive tourist, everyone showing him a thing or two about their country, and the film flounders, caught between a soft romance and a soft political treatise, accomplishing neither one very successfully. George does manage to see how close-knit and joyous the Nicaraguans can be, despite the poverty of their country, as he goes dancing with the village people. And to George&#39;s credit, he knows when enough is enough, so he resolves things with Carla, hears her song, as she resolves things with her tortured lover, who she at last finds out from Bradley, is still alive. George does the sensible thing for a highly emotional person to do, he splits from here and heads for Glasgow, supposedly a better person for having loved abandoningly and made a little bit more politically aware of how bad the Contras are by his unexpected adventure. I expect that he&#39;ll really have something to say in the pubs when he gets back home, where he belongs.\nIt really wasn&#39;t that bad of a film, it was just too flat and preachy. But it was pleasant to watch Oyanka Cabezas, she was quite innocently alluring, giving her role an authentic tone to it, as there were moments when the story seemed to be reaching for something important to say, and that she would be the best spokesperson to present the cause. But in the end, the film never managed to be all that convincing, probably because it sold its product too hard. And that is unfortunate, because I didn&#39;t learn anything new about the Nicaraguan political situation that I didn&#39;t know before. Everything seemed too pat, more like a Stanley Kramer liberal political film than a former Ken Loach politically independent film, such as his LAND AND FREEDOM.\nREVIEWED ON 4/11/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;THIN RED LINE, THE (director: Andrew Marton; cast: Keir Dullea (Pvt. Doll), Jack Warden (Sgt. Welsh), Ray Daley (Capt. Stone), James Philbrook (Col. Tall), Bob Kanter (Fife), Jim Gillen (Capt. Gaff), Kieron Moore (Lt. Band), 1964)\nBased on James Jones\&#39; WW11 novel set in Guadalcanal, that probes the love/hate relationship between a tough, grizzly veteran, Sgt. Welsh (Warden), and the young inexperienced Pvt. Doll, as Company C makes its push to take Guadalcanal from the Japanese.\nThe idea that war is insane is the underlying theme of this violent actioner, that questions the sanity of why men go to war. Sgt. Welsh prepares the men for war by picking on Pvt. Doll unfairly, accusing him of not carrying out an order even though he knows that it was carried out. When Capt. Stone (Daley) asks why he is doing this to Doll, he is told that he is teaching him not to think but to obey; that war is insane and that the sooner his men find this out, then the better able they will be to survive in the battlefield. The film\&#39;s title signifies the thin red line that one crosses between sanity and insanity in a war situation. The captain\&#39;s response is, that in civilian life we put men like Sgt. Welsh in mental institutions, but in war, the institution we put him in is the army.\nCompany C\&#39;s immediate obstacle, even before they can get used to their new war surroundings, is to traverse a swamp field that is land mined and barbed wired and heavily fortified with hidden gun nests along the swampy trails and on the hilltops, it is armed with machine gun dugouts. The idea is to keep pushing the enemy back, which means retaking all the previous villages that were taken, no matter the cost in lives to the soldiers.\nPvt. Doll is the first in his company to kill a Japanese soldier, and he does it savagely, leaving him with permanent psychological scars. Doll uses the non-army issued pistol he stole from an American soldier to kill the Japanese soldier, the gun is something that he fixed in his mind that he needed to have for further protection and could not be talked out of giving it up when Welsh discovered the theft. Doll\&#39;s idea of surviving the war is a bit different than Welsh\&#39;s, he wants to know what he is doing at all times, to think things through for himself, to be thought of as an individual, and most of all to be in charge of his own destiny.\nIn combat, C Company comes up against heavy gun fire and can\&#39;t push forward. The gung-ho Col. Tall\&#39;s (Philbrook) command to Capt. Stone is, stop worrying about casualities and take the swamp at all costs. Capt. Stone, a symbol for the rational man caught in war, who is trying his best to do his duty and look out for the safety of his men, tells the colonel that he can\&#39;t obey his command. But Sgt. Welsh comes up with a plan to mountain climb the rocky terrain with ropes for him and Doll, and to let the avalanche of rocks detonate the mines in the swamp. When Col. Tall appears on the scene, the men are pushing ahead and the blustery colonel can only bellow, What was all the fuss about ? The gory combat scenes and the heroics of the men and the craziness of the war, are vividly photographed, leaving one with a mixed impressions, perhaps,wondering if this is what it takes to win the battle, and if that is so, is it worth the price it takes to accomplish the mission. The images of the dead in the swamp, tagged with dogtags in their mouth, was appalling to behold, it is a scene that should leave one feeling a bit eerie.\nThe next objective is to take the village, but before that next offensive can begin, Capt. Stone is summoned to the colonel\&#39;s headquarters and is told that he is being removed from his command because he doesn\&#39;t have the stomach for battle. He will be given a silver star and assigned to a rear guard desk job, and nothing will go into the record about his insubordination. The look on the captain\&#39;s face is priceless; as he is stunned, all the wind is taken out of him, and all he could do is follow proper military courtesy over the decision, fully aware that he has just been given a coveted position for something that he has actually earned, but for the moment he is overcome with disappointment and regret for how he has been treated by his superior officer, and by the fact that he is so suddenly being removed from the men he feels responsible for.\nIt is now Capt. Gaff\&#39;s (Gillen) outfit to command, and the men, elated with their victory begin to celebrate by ransacking the booty the Japanese soldiers left behind, but their celebration is short-lived, as there are a number of enemy soldiers who escaped detection and are now hidden by camouflage that blends in with the trees, and their surprise attack, nearly wipes out the company, leaving them with only 27 men.\nHeroics on the part of the men, caught up in the spirit of battle, begins to get the better of them, as they decide to try and finish the job they were assigned, climbing the top of the hill and taking out the machine gunners firing down on them. Doll becomes the hero, going beyond the call of duty to lead the charge on the hill. What results, is the complete transformation of Doll into a killing machine, who, after all his confrontational conflicts with Welsh, is eventually transformed into someone he didn\&#39;t know he was.\nThis version of THE THIN RED LINE is quite different from Terrence Malick\&#39;s depersonalized 1998 one. Marton shot his war film by personalizing the men and simply telling of the atrocities they faced. It was a straight hard-nosed story, with no grandiose philosophical themes. Its message might be read into Sgt. Welsh\&#39; last words, as he is asked, &#34;Why did he take a bullet for someone like Doll, someone he didn\&#39;t even like, &#34; and he responds, &#34;Because I\&#39;m stupid.&#34; This is a blunt statement, but after all the bloody battle scenes observed, and the heavy losses on both sides, it is a fair question to ask and the response might not be one that can be taken literally, but it is one that is wrapped around a lot of emotions that can\&#39;t be articulated properly but can sure be felt.\nREVIEWED ON 4/12/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;WELCOME TO SARAJEVO (director: Michael Winterbottom; cast: Stephen Dillane (Henderson), Woody Harrelson (Flynn), Marisa Tomei (Nina), Emira Nusevic (Emira), Kerry Fox (Jane Carson), Goran Visnjic (Risto), Emily Lloyd (Annie McGee), 1997-UK)\nWhat gets into the headlines determines how most of us view the world. When the civil outbreak in Bosnia reared its ugly head, it had the unwanted task of painfully reminding the rest of the world that this troubled area was coming back to haunt the world again. Hatred of other ethnic groups has never gone away, even in the relative calm of Tito\&#39;s post-war Yugoslavia. Now that ethnic war is here again with a particular vengeance, as ethnic cleansing becomes a government policy, pitting Serbs against Muslims, the problem is dangerously out in the open.\nIn this film, the first welcome to Sarajevo you get to this forsaken region, with burnt out buildings and visable carnage everywhere, after briefly seeing the joy in the faces of a family coming out of a church from a wedding, is them being suddenly startled by the shots fired by snipers as a bullet strikes the mother of the bride, killing her instantly, as you watch her lying on the street, as reporters snap their photos from a safe distance until her body is removed by a priest and Flynn (Woody), who is a loud mouth American reporter, who backs up his big talk with brave deeds making him a likable enough person among the other foreign reporters covering the war and a bit of comic relief for the audience. The film will try to depict the horrors of the war on the civilian population balanced against the media\&#39;s reaction to what they are covering, who are only there for the story of the day, but are caught in the harsh reality of the situation, surrounded by constant danger, they are trying to find a way to keep things in perspective for themselves, to get their story while remaining sane about the madness enveloping them, to do whatever they can to make some difference in the conflict, even if they act somewhat glib in doing their job. But there is no way for a reporter to put out of his mind that more than 200,000 civilians died in this Bosnian war and of the countless other human tragedies that are so numerous, that most go unreported.\nWinterbottom focuses on the true story of a British TV reporter who grew miffed at his stations uncommitted coverage and shifted gears on them by going to an orphanage and doing a human interest story, but getting so entangled with his emotions, that he ends up adopting an abandoned girl, living and working in the orphanage, bringing her back to Great Britain with him by using some guile to make this illegal adoption possible. Stephen Dillane plays Henderson, the British reporter who felt compassionate enough to keep his promise to the young girl to free her from the misery of her country. Emira Nusevic plays herself, with the realistic sense of danger emanating from one who actually lived through this story. Henderson is shown at work along with his cameraman, Gregg (James Nesbitt), and his producer, Jane (Kerry Fox), as they compete with the rest of the media for a story and engage in untold pressures from their bosses back home. Goran Visnjic (Risto) is movingly portrayed as the local hired by the TV crew to do the driving and translating for them, while Marisa Tomei (Nina) is stereotyped as the &#34;do-gooder&#34;, working for a relief agency, sort of a throw-in role that has no depth.\nSince the war is precipitated at this point in history by the Serbs, the film has little choice but to point out that the Serbs are mainly responsible for what is happening now. To argue back and forth, to say that atrocities are committed by everyone, as it actually was during the course of this long historical conflict, would not properly explain the problem that is now occuring (1992-93) by the genocidal practice of one side. What is so forcefully happening in Sarajevo, even though it is on the news everyday, has not caught the American people\&#39;s attention as much as you might think it would.The reasons for that are many-fold, but probably one of the best reasons to explain that, is that the Clinton adminstration was too preoccupied with domestic policies to turn its full attention on a situation it had no clear policy on, and European countries also had no answers and therefore chose to safely not get involved in their own backyard affairs.\nThis film offers an honest portrait of the media in action, as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed. The film makes its point by showing after a particularly disasterous slaughter caught on film, it being replaced from the British front page headlines with a story about the impending separation of the Duke and Duchess of York. It seems as if the public could care less about what is happening there. So it shouldn\&#39;t be all that surprising that the public also showed its indifference at the box-office to this heartfelt film.\nREVIEWED ON 4/13/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;AFFLICTION (director: Paul Schrader; cast: Nick Nolte (Wade Whitehouse), Sissy Spacek (Margie Fogg), Jim True (Jack Hewitt), James Coburn (Glen Whitehouse), Willem Dafoe (Rolfe Whitehouse), Mary Beth Hurt (Lillian), Brigid Tierney (Jill), Holmes Osborne (Gordon LaRiviere), Sean McCann (Evan Twombley), Steve Adams (Mel Gordon), 1998)\nThe opening scene paints a deceptively pretty postcard picture of this small New Hampshire town, Lawford, covered with a late fall snow, as a young school aged girl wearing a red Halloween mask, Jill (Brigid), is guardedly speaking to her policeman/crossing guard father, Wade (Nolte), asking him if he was bad as a child, doing Halloween pranks, as he warily but unsuccessfully tries to respond to her in his car, as they have just left his ex-wife\&#39;s place, which is in another town about a 1/2 hour away, and are heading for a children\&#39;s Halloween party he arranged with his boss, the town selectman, Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes), especially for her sake, even though she doesn\&#39;t feel comfortable with the town or with him. His former wife, Lillian (Mary Beth Hurt), who married him twice and is now married to someone else, can no longer relate to him and his angry mood swings.\nAfter dropping Jill off at the party she doesn\&#39;t want to be at, Wade leaves the party being held at his police station, to go off smoking some weed with his much younger friend and fellow snowplower for the town, the complacent Jack Hewitt (True), who shares many of Wade\&#39;s feelings about the town they were both born in, but who is mostly pining about his chance to play minor league baseball for the Bosox coming to an abrupt end, and how he is now broke and everything seems to be leading to a dead-end.\nWe soon see that Jill really does not enjoy the visitation she has with her emotionally distraught father, even as she tells him that she loves him, she still can\&#39;t wait to get back home to her loving mother. A nasty scene develops as Jill reacts to her unhappiness at being there, by calling her mother and asking to be taken home, and when the mother arrives with her husband, Wade goes slightly ballistic, scaring the hell out of the child.\nThere is a voiceover, and the rich discernible voice of Willem Dafoe (Rolfe) is heard, as he relates that this is a story about two brothers who were afflicted by pain and violence by an abusive and alcoholic father, Glen (Coburn), and this is the story as told from his point of view, about the criminality of his brother and how it can be explained. But for most of the film, it is through Wade\&#39;s narrow focus that we see what is taking place. We don\&#39;t even get to see Rolfe until about after an hour of the film has elapsed; but, even though he has distanced himself from his family situation, teaching now at Boston University, he keeps daily contact by phone with his older sibling, who rattles on about his divorce, telling him that he is going to Concord to get a lawyer, foolishly thinking he can get custody of the children, as he also rants about his personal bitterness and the emotional difficulties he is constantly having. Since Rolfe pictures himself as the survivor of the family, the less physical of the two, he tries to help out Wade with his more rational insights, grateful that his brother had acted as a protector for him when they were growing up in a house with a demonic father and an angelic mother, but a mother who seemed helpless against the rages of her husband.\nThis is another Russell Banks novel based film that has been well-suited for the big screen (a recent one was the more personally meditative, THE SWEET HEREAFTER). AFFLICTION depicts how a man can go over the edge, just lose it completely one day, and that there is nothing anyone can do to prevent it. The inward turmoil of Wade is constantly being stirred by all the disappointments he feels about himself and his memories which are magnified by what he experiences daily in this small town. Outwardly, we see how run down he has become, even if he has stopped drinking. His constant toothache and not going to see a dentist, is overworked symbolically into the story, but it does show how he is also afflicted with physical pain that he can\&#39;t readily handle, and how he, eventually, painfully solves this problem, by pulling his aching tooth out with a pair of pliers.\nWhen Jack takes an influential visitor from Massachusetts (McCann) out hunting, and he shoots himself by accident, Wade, backed up by his brother\&#39;s shared opinion, thinks that this isn\&#39;t an accident, but perhaps, a professional hit done by the mafia or by Jack, because the visitor had enemies in his union. When Wade becomes obsessive about the accident, ranting on to Jack and his boss about their part in the crime, his brother tries to tell him that he was mistaken in thinking it was anything other than an accident, that he should forget about it and just concentrate on straightening out his own problems.\nWade\&#39;s one chance for genuine affection, is with the local waitress, Maggie (Spacek), who cares for him deeply and is willing to put up with a lot of his unpleasantries because she knows his situation and how much he has been hurt. There is the tragic visit she makes with Wade to his parents\&#39; house, where he introduces her to his dad in a visit to check on how his dad is doing, that is so draining for Wade, as she acts as a buffer between him and his still verbally abusive elderly father. But the visit ends upon the discovery that his mother froze to death because his father failed to get anyone to fix the furnace.\nBecause we see the accident through Wade\&#39;s neurotic eyes we are never quite sure what it is we have seen, but by the time the movie winds down and Wade unravels, we see how pervasive corruption is in this economically depressed town, and we hope that Wade can move in that direction to get the guilty culprits instead of chasing something he might have imagined. But since this story is mostly a psychological thriller, we are caught in the web of Nolte\&#39;s very compelling characterization, as he is someone who puts us into his shoes, so that we can\&#39;t help seeing what a tormented person he is, and are really unsure for the time being whether a crime was committed or not, until by the film\&#39;s end, then everything seems to come into place, and we realize how far gone Wade has become. Nolte is so good in this role, that we can actually feel Wade\&#39;s traumas reverberating within us.\nThe other standout performances come from Brigid Tierney, who almost steals the film from the veteran actors Nolte and Coburn, because of how genuine she comes across in her very pertinent role as a young child having to distance herself from a father she is afraid to love. Coburn is convincingly good as the cold-hearted father, who recognizes that his older son has inherited his traits. His iconoclastic and memorable portrayal of an abusive father, is very hard- hitting and original. Holmes Osborne and Jim True look and act as if they stepped out of the streets in rural New England, and were actually who they portrayed on screen. Sissy Spacek was her usual sweet self. These characterizations made the bleakness of the story delightfully credible and penetrating.\nLiving in a small New England town myself, I can attest to how uncannily realistic the town and the people in it appeared to be.\nSchrader (the director of TAXI DRIVER) is so uniquely suited to do this type of film, as he makes the most of this absorbing look into these troubled men\&#39; psyches, holding up a mirror of truth, to see if it is still possible for those who are so troubled to see themselves in someone else and to astutely ascertain what it is they are doing to themselves. One of Wade\&#39;s greatest fears was that he was becoming like his father.\nCreating a portrait of how a dysfunctional family is, without being trite about it, is not that easy to accomplish, especially since this kind of subject matter is old news by now. But this film accomplished that by creating an edgy mood piece, that has to be watched carefully, because it is filled with plenty of jewels for those who are willing to dig them out in the dark spaces they are to be found in, where one man\&#39;s plight becomes something that can be so universally felt.\nThat is not to say that this film didn\&#39;t have moments of reaching too far afield and failing miserably, such as trying to make Wade out to be a Christ figure, while as a crossing guard he freezes at not seeing his daughter going to school and stretches his arms out in a crucified position, as Mel Gordon (Adams) representing &#34;new&#34; money in town disrespectfully speeds by him. That representation is not the Wade we see for most of the film, the Wade who is the local good guy, willing to get along with all the other locals, until he loses his equilibrium. That is the more accurate portrayal of the volatile Wade, who is also capable of taking someone\&#39;s life and not capable of overcoming his horrible childhood.\nREVIEWED ON 4/18/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;SNAKE EYES (director: Brian De Palma; cast: Nicholas Cage, Gary Sinise,Carla Gugino, Luis Guzman, Stan Shaw, Kevin Dunn, John Heard, 1998)\nAfter a brilliant, stylish opening sequence, this film begins to unravel and by the time it ends, it is a misfire. Cage and Sinise play well off each other: Sinise reserved (just right for the part), Cage frenetic (over - emoting but still very effective). Cage is the free - spirited, corrupt Atlantic City cop and childhood friend of Sinise, who is the naval officer in charge of security for the secretary of defense.\nHe is in Atlantic City to protect the secretary while he attends the heavyfight fight, that turns out to be fixed; Cage is his guest, he is only there to watch the fight, but in some ludicrous way becomes in charge of the investigation after the assassination.The assassination taking place in the crowded boxing venue is masterfully done, and well worth the price of admission, as De Palma goes crazy with his cameras offering numerous shots from all different angles of the crowd and the casino.\nWe are witnesses to this assassination from many different perspectives. We soon learn who the villains are, so the picture that so brilliantly set - up an interesting set of conflicts between the characters such as: loyalty, corruption, sense of duty, patriotism, and one&#39;s own personal dilemmas begins to go off in another direction, in the direction of where the film - makers think it can draw in the box office crowds, that is, it turns into a flat action movie, where things are easily predictable and we are cut off from any emotional involvement with the characters.\nThe camera is the only star of this film. In the end, this became a very annoying picture that promised so much and only delivered what could be best described, as superficial entertainment.\nREVIEWED ON 9/18/98\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE (director: Jean Eustache; cast: Jean-Pierre Léaud (Alexandre), Bernadette Lafont (Marie), Françoise Lebrun (Veronika), Isabelle Weingarten (Gilberte), Jacques Renard (friend of Alexandre), 1973-France)\nHaving lived through and somehow survived the cultural revolutions of the late 60s and early 70s American style, not fully aware of what the French upheaval was all about, except to notice that there was more of an identification over there between the working-class and intellectuals, and not the same usage of hallucinogenic drugs and anti-Vietnam protests that was sweeping the American landscape. I was therefore most interested that this film tackled the subject of revolution totally by looking through the eyes of sexual change, following the trail of a professional idler, in his late 20s, Alexandre (Léaud), who manages not to work, own an apartment or possess many material things, doing this by living off the women he has affairs with, who supply him with food, an apartment to share, clothes, and perhaps even some money.\nWe first meet Alexandre as he arrives at the Sorbonne to get confirmation that his relationship is all over with the coed who just dumped him for another man, Gilberte (Isabelle), who tells him it is definetly over between them, she is marrying this other man. Alexandre pleads his case, professing his love for her, cunningly trying to win her back, but to no avail. We subsequently learn that Gilberte was a virgin when he met her, and even though he treated her badly, he still believes he loves her very much. Despondent with her decision, he comes out of the bohemian cafe he hangs out in, Deux Magots, and eyes this very attractive blond. His pick-up line to her is, &#34;I don\&#39;t have time to have a drink with you but can I have your telephone number.&#34; This girl turns out to be Veronika (Lebrun), who is the whore of the story, a Slavic nurse, in her 20s, and someone who professes a dire need to have casual sex with as many offers as she can entertain, especially enjoying it with exotic outsiders, like Jews and Arabs. Going on to tell Alexandre that her relationships don\&#39;t last too long, but that men are very attracted to her because she has a big ass, nice breasts, a sensual mouth, and when she wears make-up her eyes appear very sexy. Alexandre chimes in, that he also likes her when she smiles.\nWhen Alexandre returns to the apartment he shares with his lover, the mother of the story, the 30ish, well-endowed boutique owner, Marie (Lafont), who in real-life was the ex-lover of the director of the film, who never acted before, but has a strong sexual presence in this film, he tells her most everything about what he does, including his new lady friend.\nAfter we see how rakish and supposedly cool Alexandre is, and hear his amusing rantings about life, philosophy and love, (he sure loves to talk nonstop) we also discover that he has a double-standard about sex, being not so free and easy when it comes to having his women folk do the same thing he does to them.\nThis &#34;take me seriously&#34; three and a half-hour film is surprisingly never dull, and is always diverting and titillating in its sexual characterization of these three rather likable and vulnerable participants in experimental living, that has its ups and downs as far as their compulsive libertine tendencies go. We follow the relationship over a few weeks grow between Veronika and him, in-between bouts of too much drinking, chain smoking and sharing a bed with the at-first antagonistic Marie, but a soon to be more accepting Marie, until her true feelings emerge again, as she attempts suicide but is stopped by Alexandre, and then we are treated to hearing one of the best &#34;I am a whore&#34; speeches I ever heard, as Veronike fesses up to wanting to be loved, that sex is really nothing to her even though she enjoys coming the maximum number of times, (she has some kind of thing about saying maximum whenever she can) but is not ashamed that she is free enough to go to bed with whomever she desires, claiming that she is better than the hypocrite housewife who dreams of screwing the plumber or some stranger, but never acts on her desire.\nConfessions and half-baked philosophies come pouring out of this film at the drop of a fancy scarf, as Alexandre states he can\&#39;t love a woman who doesn\&#39;t love him. While Marie demands that she could have other relationships also, just like he does. With all the so-called sexual freedom they have, it is discernible that there seems to be a lot of tension around them, making one wonder really if they are enjoying themselves more than their bourgeoisie counterparts are.\nAlexandre\&#39;s male friend (Renard), also an idler, is quite a zany, hanging out at the same cafes Alexandre frequents, showing a keen interest in Nazism as a cultural nostalgia, and wheeling his able bodied self around in his apartment in a wheel chair stolen from a cripple. All the quirkiness and nonsensical palaver of childish 1970s rebellion is seen here, along with a strong sense of connecting with others of the similar mind-set, allowing sex to be the liberating experience that it should be for them, if what they are into is to be taken seriously as some kind of revoluntionary statement.\nThe film culminates with Alexandre forcing himself into making a choice between the two women who love him, and choosing the more youthful blond when she is at her most vulnerable. He asks Veronika to marry him as she is vomiting into a bucket, as the scene fades out with him sitting in her apartment, about to become a married man. This is not your typical Hollywood romantic happy ending for a film, but one that is very fitting for this film.\nIt is worth noting, that the director of this seminal work, Jean Eustache, killed himself at age 42 in 1981, and that certainly some parts of this film were based on his real-life experiences.\nThe acting is superb. Léaud the boyish charmer, is self-absorbed, prattling on and on about himself and what he thinks he knows about life, that is both comically funny and sad, while at all times he acts the part of the compulsive sex freak. The only thing that is impressive about his intellect, was that he is often seen carrying a book by Proust under his arms as he goes to the cafe to read, which is bookmarked to the story about &#34;The Captive.&#34; All the women are special in their roles, making us look at them bodily-wise as well as at their mind. I see very little differences between the 1973 sexual mores and the 1999 ones. The later year is when I saw this film on video for the first time.\nHow this film plays out, depends on one\&#39;s perspective about sex and relationships, and how important they are; if, perhaps, they are the most important worldly concerns one has, even more important than money or career or philosophy, then this film should prove to not only be entertaining but mindful. If thought of, as otherwise, then the film could still prove to be a most revealing study of how women look at men, especially men who think they are real smoothies. It also should indicate that women often choose these smoothies over other men because they like to play games with men and feel comfortable being around such men.\nWhat the film accomplishes, is to not rely on its plot and on any particular message, but to allow things to happen as they normally would, relying on the compelling nature of the actors to garner our interest, and our natural curiousity about what makes us love one another until it reaches the surface of some common understanding. That this was successfully done, can be attested by me from my own experiences and how important sex was for me in forming a relationship during the 1970s, it also seemed to shape my attitudes in love and in the sense I had of the world. Sex always seems to be revolutionary because it is never static, it is never quite done in the same way.\nThis film shows no signs of its age, it is impressive enough for me to watch today as it was for me to live vicariously through it in my thoughts of the 1970s. I think that the filmmaker could do no wrong in this film, every gesture and endless chat seemed so terribly right. And if the film is not an optimistic one, then that is just the way the filmmaker saw the situation of the lovers.\nREVIEWED ON 4/17/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS (director: Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky; cast: Damien Wayne Echols, Jason Baldwin, Jessie Miskelly,1996)\nIt is hard to believe how fictional the truth can seem, at times, as it is played out in earnest for this documentary, without actors or script, just by those involved in the crime scene, as the film goes into gross detail, describing the horrific murders of the three second-graders, Christopher Byers, Steven Branch, Michael Moore, found with mutilated bodies, on May 5, 1993, in a wooded area near West Memphis, Arkansas, which the locals call Robin Hood Hills, and then following-up the trial of the three teens accused of this crime, whose motive was attributed to their being in a satanic cult.\nCrime is as American as apple pie, and unfortunately, bizarre murders are not that uncommon on the American landscape. But when the victims are three innocent 8-year-olds, emotions naturally run high, that there is a public outcry to get the killers and either execute them or give them life sentences, as we look at ourselves and ask who could do such a thing and why. We also want those who did it caught as soon as possible; we want to see how our criminal system works: from police, to prosecutors, to lawyers, to judges, and to jury. For most of us, we have formed an opinion on how we think it works, even if we realize that statistics of arrests and convictions do not tell us the whole story. It is not until we see an actual trial, do we sense how delicate a system we have, how in the hands of forthright, honest, intelligent, and fair-minded participants, the system should work fine, but if that is not so, we better watch out, the system can backfire on us and make us scratch our heads and wonder if it is possible for justice to work. And that is what this objective documentary does, as it allows us into the courtroom to see how the participants do their job.\nFor some reason there is a separate trial for Jessie Miskelly, the pint sized 17-year-old, who has an IQ of 72, he speaks in a slow and deliberately awkward manner, and seems less intelligent than even that low score indicates. He is the one the police picked up and questioned after a month of mounting pressure against them that they have bungled the case, by getting a confession out of him, without a lawyer present, and after he at first denied doing the crime. In his flimsy confession where he does not even accurately state what has happened, he goes on to implicate two other friends in the crime, the meek and slightly mentally deficient Jason Baldwin, and the more intelligent and articulate Damien Wayne Echols, who antagonizes the small-town by being into heavy metal music, his favorite group being Metallica, and purchasing a book he got from the library on a witches movement called Wicca (white magic), which he says he only read about and does not practice, and that he also antagonizes most citizens of the town, by dressing in black, which his father caustically comments, &#34;Even Johnny Cash wears black.&#34; In other words, these three friends, who were not interested in sports and appeared to be different in temperament and attitude than the rest of the town, were looked upon with hostile suspicion, even before the crime.\nThe filmmakers spend a lot of time with Jesse\&#39;s family and with the lawyer\&#39;s defending him, and going over his confession, which he now says is not true, and all of them come to the conclusion that Jesse was a frightened boy, who just gave that confession to get out of the police line of questioning. He supposedly has an alibi for when the murders took place, but the filmmakers did not reveal what his alibi was or for that matter what the other accused boys\&#39; alibis were, for a reason I cannot understand. In any case, there is nothing to link him to the crime except for the dubious nature of the confession. There is absolutely no physical evidence of any kind at the crime scene to implicate him and his friends, even though all the victims bled, and one lost 5 pints of blood while bleeding to death. It is highly unlikely that Jessie and his passive friends would have been able to do the crime, not withstanding that they had no reason to do it, and then after the crime be so thorough in covering up any evidence. Just seeing them and hearing their story, and seeing no solid proof put forward, except for innuendo and a coerced confession, is not what I call a solid case against them.\nJessie was found guilty and given a life sentence plus 40 years, even though, in his confession, he claimed not to murder any one, he just held down the Moore boy for the others to kill. It was made apparently clear that the police and the prosecutors, were not looking for any reason to exonerate these three from the crime. These rational men, defenders of the law, were satisfied and even smug with the job they were doing. The job they did frightened the heck out of me, because of their unwillingness to check everything out, and as much as the crime revolted me, this revolted me with almost equal disdain.\nWe also see a hair raising bit of unexpected melodrama, from John Mark Byers, stepfather of one of the victims, as he is caught on videotape recreating how he thinks the murders took place, calling on God for vengeance. This guy was more frightening to watch than the three accused of the crime, and indeed the defense team suspected him of doing the crime, but since the police refused to really question this guy seriously, except the man himself, did say, he gave his step-son a spanking for misbehaving shortly before the crime took place. Later on in the case presented against the two remaining defendents, who are tried together, he gives a knife he has to the filmmakers, who turn it over to the prosecutors, who find blood traces on it with his blood and his step-sons. There is no follow up to the fact that he stated there was no reason for there being blood on the knife, since he never used it before. But under questioning from the defense attorney, he now remembers cutting himself with it. This is a knife that could have very likely been used in the crime.\nThere is also a manager of a local fast food place, who said on the late afternoon of the gruesome murder he called the police to his Bojangles, because there was a blackman in the woman\&#39;s rest room with blood all over him. The police, even though they were aware a bloody murder had just happened, did not apprehend this man or follow this lead up in their investigation.\nThe trial of Damian and Jason is hinged on the claim that they committed the act as a ritual killing for their satanic group, something that the state has absolutely no evidence on, but the testimony of a mail order Dr., who claims to be an expert on cult groups, even though the accused both deny being in any kind of group, and no one can offer proof that they are in such a group. They call themselves loners. Though, Damian has a girlfriend he has a baby with, he is not an active participant in any gang or cult. On camera she states that Damian couldn\&#39;t harm anyone, she is confident that he couldn\&#39;t have done the crime. Jason could hardly say a word, and seems to be mortified, not really aware of what is going on, and appears to have no connection with anything occult, except he likes to hang around with Damien and listen to heavy metal music.\nNeedless to say, they are convicted of the crimes, even though Jessie recants his confession and refuses to cut a deal with the prosecutors for a reduced sentence, to testify against his friends, because he would be lying, and his mother said that she would be in court to watch him, to make sure he doesn\&#39;t tell a lie.\nDamian gets the death penalty, while Jason gets a life sentence. Their sentences are now under appeal.\nIf ever there was to be a public outcry against how the judicial system works and the arbitrary use of the death penalty, this film should give you food for thought about how unfair the judicial system can be for those who are of the poor class. It was frightening for me to watch how the process works. There is no outcry from the community about injustice, and even if this case is the exception to the way the courts operate, that most cases are handled with more of a search for justice and with less of a rush to judgment, which I sincerely doubt, this compelling documentary leaves me perplexed, not only in my questioning of the verdict, but the whole process itself, and wondering if our system is so flawed, that it would really be damaging to impose a death penalty sentence on anyone, realizing how political all verdicts appear to be.\nREVIEWED ON 4/21/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;CHAIN LETTERS (director: Mark Rappaport; cast: Mark Arnott (Paul), Reed Birney (Greg), David Brisbin (Phil), Randy Danson (Beth), Marilyn Jones (Tracy),Ellen McElduff (Eva), Joan MacIntosh (Evelyn), Dan Davis (Steve), Robert Schenkkan (Rick),1985)\nA chain letter is mysteriously started, after an office worker is choked to death by a guy in a red ski mask with a piece of string, who steals the letters and then mails some of them. What then transpires is a whacky, and I do mean whacky story, not unlike a conspiracy theory, as it offers comments on violence, sibling rivalries, paranoia, on both heterosexual- and- gay relationships, and reasons why we shouldn\&#39;t trust our government, using the example of how it lied about the agent orange use on our soldiers during the Vietnam War and how the government has secret projects that it uses on the unsuspecting public to do its unsavory experiments on, as these letters interconnect with the lives of 9 diverse characters, who some how or other connect with each other.\nThis is a Mark Rappaport film, so if you are expecting to see a convential film, you have walked into the wrong theater. His tongue-in-cheek humor is as always, delightfully absurd. All 9 characters play co-starring roles, with no one dominating the film. And it works, in an odd sort of way, making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene, even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder.\nThis is a film about troubled characters and a chance for Rappaport to direct his weird humor into the inanely funny lines spoken by them, as each character is out of it, in a neurotic way. The characters appear in short skits, trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy, spewing out lame jokes and theories, self-absorbed with their own neurotic tendencies, while many of them are hungering for sex and violence, and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on.\nPaul(Mark) is seen at a wall map, discussing with Beth (Randy) a WW11 movie he saw, believing everything is planned out in life by a series of dots, and life is simple if we can just understand the plan, which is right under our noses, as it should have been for the Nazi general depicted in the film he saw last night. He plays the part of a guy with a screw loose after his Vietnam War days, who likes to screw women and play out his paranoia until it is real. Beth thrives on sex. She is also seeing Paul\&#39;s brother, Phil (David), who is a college teacher, expounding in the lecture she attends, about sharks who have within them eggs called ovaphagos, which devour their own brothers in the womb. Paul is also screwing Evelyn (Joan), who is Paul\&#39;s main girl, but who in contrast to Paul, sees life as a river flowing with the water muddied.\nOn a NYC train, Evelyn, who works in an architect\&#39;s office, is leered at by Steve (Dan), who is in business producing high tech security products. Greg (Reed) is also aboard the same train car, and is gay, but he also services ladies, and is not known to Steve, but he is the paid stud for Steve\&#39;s ex-wife, concerned about aging, Eva (Ellen), who works as a research scientist, who has previously dated Phil, as her interest in Phil is rekindled through the chain letter received. Eva and Beth are sisters. Greg, through the courtesy of the chain letter, makes contact with Phil, telling him that he knows that Phil secretly wants to have a gay affair, which Phil acknowledges, just wondering how Greg detected that about him, since he believes that he has so carefully disguised that fact about himself.\nSteve meets a former soap teenage star, Tracy (Marilyn), in the supermarket, who is living with the macho, gun toting, black motorcycle jacketed, Rick (Robert), who looks like Greg, and by coincidence, Greg has met on the street, believing he might be secretly gay, and has struck up a friendship with, hoping they can, at least, be best friends.\nSteve has sex with the outspoken Tracy, and is presented with a t-shirt that matches hers, &#34;If it isn\&#39;t stiff- it isn\&#39;t worth a fuck,&#34; as the sophisticated Steve reluctantly dons it to walk with her on the street, where he surprisingly runs into the woman he was attracted to on the subway, Evelyn, who turns out to be Tracy\&#39;s sister, a sister that she can\&#39;t stand. After Tracy rips up the phone number her sister gives her, Steve takes it from her and reassembles it to call Evelyn for a date. After their date turns out to be cordial, but with no sex in the offering, they part ways with a handshake; and, on the street, Rick guns down Greg, because Greg has left him, and Paul, who hates Steve, thinking he is having an affair with his Evelyn, spots them together in the same street where Greg is shot, so he uses a high powered rifle to kill Steve from the building he has positioned himself on, getting a nod of approval from Rick.\nThat should cover enough of the plot for any one who needs to know what he is seeing before he determines if he should venture out to rent this on video. All I could honestly say, is that I enjoyed it. It was like a nice cold drink, on a hot summer day, offering me something for my thirst, as I wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one, after all, the plot of this film is not completely insane. And as Paul so ably says, &#34;Everything is a plot, it is just not clear what it is.&#34;\nREVIEWED ON 4/21/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,

 &#34;RUSHMORE (director: Wes Anderson; cast: Jason Schwartzman (Max Fischer), Bill Murray (Blume), Olivia Williams (Miss Cross), Brian Cox (Dr. Guggenheim), Seymour Cassel (Bert Fischer), Mason Gamble (Dirk Calloway), Sara Tanaka (Margaret Yang), Stephen McCole (Magnus Buchan), Ronnie McCawley (Ronny Blume), Keith McCawley (Donny Blume), Luke Wilson (Dr. Peter Flynn), 1998)\nThis is a fantasy film that comically depicts one current student making contact with another former student of the same school, who is now a tycoon, who when he looks back at his high school days, might recall what it was about those years that now fill him with nostalgia, and how he might be an influence to other students not considered to be top flight students yet who possess the guts it takes to become successful.\nRUSHMORE opens, as an irrepressible sophomore at an elite private school, the 15-year-old Max Fischer (Schwartzman), who is the future tycoon, is daydreaming that he can solve an impossible math problem his math teacher put on the board for extra-credit that no one else in the world can solve. In reality, he is a poor academic student, having won a scholarship to the school when he was in the 2nd grade, by staging a play that the headmaster (Brian Cox ) of Rushmore Academy was impressed with. His father is the town barber, but Max prefers to tell people that his father is a neurosurgeon. The father is paternally played with a very sweet charm, by veteran actor, Seymour Cassel.\nThis is an original and quirky story, but it also follows a long tradition of films that took similar routes (FERRIS BUELLER&#39;S DAY OFF, THE GRADUATE), so what seems to be taking place and in what direction it is going and who Max is, cannot be simply or absolutely stated, which is great in some ways but completely mind-blowing in other ways, as this somewhat cheesy story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese, yet no matter how it seems to be served, it always seems to be a story that is tastefully done.\nMax appears with thick spectacles, wearing braces, and not appealing to girls or not even liked by any one on campus except for a young student he is an advisor to, Dirk (Mason), who acts as a loyal subject to Max&#39;s cause, only disillusioned when he hears that Max made some sexually disparaging remarks about his mother. Max is not exactly a nerd, as he is pushy, being neither completely likable nor obnoxious, who propels himself into the Rushmore scene by pursuing extra-curricular activities to such a degree that it reaches the point of absurdity, as he is involved in so many diverse activities, that it is a wonder he has time to even take off the preppy jacket he loves to wear around the campus. The list of his activities includes: Beekeepers Club, The Dodgeball Society, The French Club, The Debating Team, The Fencing Team, editor of the school&#39;s paper, The Piper Cub Club, The Max Fischer Players, they put on plays, which seem ridiculously overplayed, such as Serpico in which he directs and stars in.\nRushmore is Max&#39;s symbolic place, tantamount to that august mountain top where replicas of some of our greatest presidents are carved in stone. It is at Rushmore where he is bursting with untold energy for adventure, entrepenureship, and romance. Everything he does is what someone his age might want to do or dream about, but he carries it out from fantasy land into the real world, not deterred by what others may think of him, or of how totally off-the-wall he appears. Oblivious to his poor school work, except when the headmaster reminds him that if he doesn&#39;t improve his grades, he will be expelled from school, scholarship or not.\nHe falls foolishly in love with a 25-year-old elementary teacher at the school, charmingly played by Miss Cross (Williams), who looks bemusedly perplexed at him, but, nevertheless, somehow admires him for the effort he puts forth in stating his feelings for her. Her husband recently died, but spoke fondly of his attending Rushmore, which is the reason she chose for coming here to teach. Max plans to win her over by building her an aquarium, as a token of his affection. The money for this pie-in-the-sky project will come from a steel tycoon, Herman Blume (Murray), whom he met after the former graduate of the school gave a speech there that seemed to only impress him, as the tycoon told what the school meant to him, in a flippant way that alumni usually don&#39;t reminisce about when giving a formal speech in an auditorium.\nBlume, as the present day tycoon looking back at his days at Rushmore, as the springboard of his success, just as he looks back at his marriage with remorse, develops a natural kinship with Max, the tycoon-in-waiting, that is beautifully presented by an understated performance by Murray, who draws comedy by just raising an eyebrow at the right moment or when befuddled lighting two cigarettes in his mouth, and who evinces pathos when he seems inundated by his dislike of himself for the unfeeling person he has become.\nThere are many twists to come into play as the story is disarmingly told, forcing us not too get too comfortable in what we expect to be a sane commentary of the going-ons here. The twist in the story that works best, and is both hilariously amusing and deadly serious, is that Blume, trapped in a loveless marriage, falls for the teacher, also, and is able to romance her. Max acts particularly upset by this turn of events, venting out at all the parties he perceives are hurting him. These scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend, as the story flipped over from comedy to psychological drama, and to a certain extent, a temporary suspension of belief. Yet it was this facet of the story that was most novel and daring about the film, as it let the characters freely play out who they were without contrivance. Therefore, even if you didn&#39;t particularly care about the way things were going, you were at least taken aback by seeing how everyone interacted with each other. Max showing himself to be rude and insulting, going to great lengths to end the relationship between the two lovers, somehow believing that he should have been taken seriously as a real suitor. Blume retaliating by smashing the kid&#39;s bike. Max getting back at Blume, by cutting the brakes to Blume&#39;s Bentley. Miss Cross by showing that she&#39;s a sensitive and vulnerable woman, who wants to feel alive and romantic, and doesn&#39;t really understood that she is being wooed by men who can&#39;t take no for an answer.This is the part of the film that I had the most problems with, especially when we see her going out with an attractive doctor (Luke), a Harvard graduate, like she is, and he seems to be the odd man out for no decipherable reason that the story expands on.\nWhen Max gets kicked out of Rushmore and goes to the inferior public high school, he continues to do poorly in his school work but will excel once again in extra-curricular activities, even putting on an anti-Vietnam War play with live ammo, requiring the audience to put on earplugs and wear goggles. He even finds an Oriental girlfriend (Tanaka), who is not quite the scientist she seems to be, which in this case is a good thing, because that makes her just about right for Max.\nThe young director&#39;s previous film, BOTTLE ROCKET, was also written by him with Owen Wilson, it was also quirky but a bit less professionally done. Both films show promise of better things to come. There are still patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned along the edges before we can say we have things in order, but after saying that, I must say that this is still a first-rate film, with a lot of bite to it, depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them to be very real and formidable. This is Bill Murray&#39;s best role yet, and for newcomer, Jason Schwartzman, the son of actress Talia Shire, a role made for him in filmdom heaven.\nREVIEWED ON 4/13/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;THE MISFITS (director: John Huston; cast: Clark Gable (Gay Langland), Marilyn Monroe (Roslyn Taber), Montgomery Clift (Perce Howland), Thelma Ritter (Isabelle Steers), Eli Wallach (Guido), 1961)\nEven though, Arthur Miller wrote this film for Marilyn, and she was most affecting in this vulnerable role she had, this was possibly the best role Gable ever had, excluding GWTW. He told friends he was working with a bunch of loonies: At the time of the film\&#39;s shooting, Clift was abusing drugs and on the verge of a mental breakdown, and Arthur and Marilyn were experiencing marital woes. Also, it is interesting to note that this was both Clark\&#39;s and Marilyn\&#39;s last film. He died of a heart attack just 2 days after shooting the film. Friends say that his rapid loss of 40 pounds to be fit for the film and look good for Marilyn, may have precipitated the attack, though this was denied by the surviving Gable family. Clark insisted on doing all the rigorous stunts for the film. Marilyn\&#39;s supposed suicide, came shortly after the film opened.\nThe Misfits is about some modern day Reno denizens who have trouble fitting into society, as they question life and their motives for doing what they are doing. Gable is the cowboy who is a hard drinker and fast with the women, but suffers from an inner melancholy. Monroe is the recent divorcee, coming to Reno to get out of a bad marriage, who is over-sensitive, and is confused about who she is. Eli is the second banana to Clark, who pretends to feel things he doesn\&#39;t feel, expecting to make deals with everyone in order to carry out this charade of good guy, but still fails to mask his envy for Gable, when the chips are down. Clift is the honest cowboy hurt by the injustice of life, who bemoans the fact that his father died in an accident and left the ranch he loves more than anything else in this world to his mother, who has remarried, and her new husband has the gall to offer Clift wages to work the ranch he once owned. He is now wandering aimlessly on the rodeo circuit, and is supposedly the young heroic version of Gable.\nMarilyn acts as the mother superior to all these men who are attracted to her both physically and spiritually. The film tries to debunk the Western myth of rugged individualism, by showing how vulnerable they are and how they try to mask their feelings by acting tough. After much verbage, the climactic mustang round-up scene culminates in a heavily laden bout of symbolism referring to the cowboy mentality and their need to be free and independent, which Arthur Miller calls as pure poppycock, a myth that was created and maintained by those who really don\&#39;t know what a cowboy life really is like. If you are looking for that kind of Western here, you will not find it, even though you have a director and stars of the film who have been very successful in previous Western films, depicting that genre as it has come to be expected. There are no heroes here, only lonely people trying to live with their illusions, just like the audience is trying to see them as they were led to believe cowboys should be like. All this might be confusing for those who never dreamed they would see a Western with its stars having psychological problems, and worried about earning a living. That sounds too much like what ordinary people are going through.\nThis is a superior Western despite its non-action and debunking of one of cinema\&#39;s great myths, mainly because of its incisive characterizations of these misfits, and because it was fun watching these big stars work together, especially when realizing that there was a lot of truth in the script that pertained to their real-life situations.\nREVIEWED ON 6/27/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;BELOVED (director: Jonathan Demme; cast: Oprah Winfrey (Sethe), Danny Glover (Paul D), Thandie Newton(Beloved), Kimberly Elise (Denver), Beah Richards (Baby Suggs), Lisa Gay Hamilton (Younger Sethe), Albert Hall (Stamp Paid), Irma P. Hal(Ella) and Carol Jean Lewis (Janey Wagon), 1998)\nAn excrutiatingly long (the film runs 174 minutes) adaptation of Pulitizer Prize winning author Toni Morrison\&#39;s book, based on the true story of runaway slave Margaret Garner. The film version centers around the psychological problems a former single parent slave named Sethe (Oprah) has, as she tries to live her life as a free person. I have not read the book, but as others who read the book have commented, this is a very difficult work to bring to film because the author\&#39;s words are so literary imaginative and poetic, such works have in the past resulted in poorly shot films. That is not the case here. Toni Morrison has said, that she is very pleased with the outcome of the film. Demme has sort of solved the literary problem by making this film into a ghost story, as the strong visualizations are used as metaphors for the inhumanity of slavery and the lasting impressions it stamps on the minds of the victims. There can be no doubt of how brutal a system slavery is; and Demme uses images, such as a dog having his eyes gauged out and subliminally invective flashbacks of slaves being hung and whipped, to point out the psychological scars that remain upon the people who lived through this very dark period of America\&#39;s history. And these scars and hatreds of that period are still with present day America, as it wrestles with its past and the deep racial divisions it has created.\nThe frightening and intense emotional mood this film sets is appropriate for the seriousness of the issues it brings to the table, and the deprivation it causes in the country cannot be minimized in any degree, which it isn\&#39;t here. This is an honest picture, ever faithful to the book\&#39;s author and the subject matter. But there were definite flaws in this film that detracted from it, such as the poor editing and pace of the film. The first and middle parts of the film dragged on for too long, as it just failed to hold one\&#39;s attention to the story for long periods of time; and, it was, also, shot, for the most part, in shadowy night colors making the dark screen unpleasant to watch.\nWhat was emotionally moving about the film, were its very striking visualizations, such as the use of the haunted house to make certain that slavery is understood as a haunting experience, that stays with people who experienced it, and that its ills may be deemed permanent for those who can\&#39;t exorcize the demons slavery has thrust onto the land. The haunted house is scary, its apparition of the baby that Sethe (Oprah) had killed rather than return her to slavery in Sweet Home, indicates how the hope for the Negro is in the new generation, the old can just hope to survive and be free. The ghost scenes in Sethe\&#39;s house were strong enough messages to scare away any company she might want to have.\nBut I was not crazy about the casting of Oprah in the major role of the film, she was certainly adequate for the part (there was a stoic strength about her that was needed in her performance, and she provided that), but she did not show a deep enough range of emotions that a more accomplished actress would have shown. When Danny Glover (Paul D.), was on screen, the film had an electricity to it, but when Oprah was on screen without him, the film lagged.\nWhen reminiscing with Sethe about their slave days at Sweet Home, Paul D. has this great line to sum up his slave days, &#34;It was not sweet and it was not home.&#34;\nThe strength of the film lies in the energy it picks up in its final scenes, as the story clearly came together, and all the images throughout the film began to add up and make sense, and it was able to leave an indelible mark on the viewer that lasts long after seeing the film, in fact, the film gets better when you start thinking about it long after you have seen the film, and only unique, visionary pictures are capable of doing that.\nThe film opens, after showing the simple grave with only the word &#34;Beloved&#34; marked on it. Sethe is living in an old broken down house in the outskirts of Cincinnatti, in 1873, eight years after the Civil War freed the slaves. She lives there with her teenage daughter Denver (Kimberly), her two sons having run away from this haunted house and sad life. Denver clings to Sethe, being too afraid to venture out of the immediate area of the house by herself. That she evolves as the story moves on and learns how to take care of herself, is one of the refreshing surprises that comes about, as Kimberley\&#39;s performance is very gratifying and touching to behold, especially to see how she matures and grows up from her very weak stature in life. She becomes the real heroine of the story.\nSethe and Denver have learned to live with what they have when Paul D. (Glover) shows up at their house. He has not seen her since they escaped from slavery in Kentucky 18 years ago. He moves in and they become family, but the ghost in the house becomes agitated by this and reappears in an otherworldly girl named Beloved (Thandie), who is taken in by Sethe. By having Beloved live with her, Sethe\&#39;s contented life can no longer be, and the bad memories resurface, as the ghost that is in Beloved, is clearly the young girl Sethe once killed.\nWhat unfolds, is the coming to grips with the spectre of slavery and the misery it caused to Sethe as she is forced to relive the sin she has done. Beloved\&#39;s performance is eerie and painstaking, I wouldn\&#39;t call it a great performance, but it is gut-wrenching to watch how weird she behaves, drooling and stuffing food in her mouth like an animal, as Sethe doesn\&#39;t know how to reach her and love her, yet feels remorseful about her. She looks at her, as if she was her own daughter, so it is not surprising when she says that she would do the same thing again if she had to choose between slavery and a young girl\&#39;s life. One of the most powerful lines in the film is when the tender-skinned Beloved, who would have been the same age as Sethe\&#39;s Beloved if she were alive, says to her, &#34;Why you have me? Why you leave me?&#34;\nThe other powerful woman in the story is Baby Suggs (Beah Richards), who is Sethe\&#39;s mother-in-law, a spiritual healer of the Negroes, whose performance is only too brief in the film, she brings life to the film that is in desperate need of revitalization during its many dull lapses. But fortunately, Demme is able to show the natural beauty of where they live and the warmth and strength of the Afro-Americans and their ability to stick together to help one another in times of despair, this is especially so with the women folk who turned to Jesus for strength, as they are shown praying with Baby Suggs.\nWhen Sethe is ready to face up to the realities and misdeeds slavery does to human beings, her vitality improves for awhile, as she exclaims to Paul D, &#34;feel how it feels to be a colored woman roaming the roads with anything God made liable to jump on you. Feel that.&#34;\nI still think that I should have read the book to really feel what &#34;that&#34; is, even if the film was credible enough, I imagine the book is that much more pertinent and that much more powerful than this very interesting and intelligent film, that views slavery in an unforgettable way, perhaps, in a way, that audiences have not visualized the evil consequences of slavery before seeing this film.\nREVIEWED ON 11/20/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;GO (director: Doug Liman; cast: Desmond Askew (Simon Baines), Taye Diggs (Marcus), William Fichtner (Burke), J.E. Freeman (Victor Sr.), Katie Holmes (Claire Montgomery), Jay Mohr (Zack), Timothy Olyphant (Todd Gaines), Sarah Polley (Ronna Martin), Scott Wolf (Adam), Breckin Meyer (Tiny), 1999)\nA zippy youth oriented Christmas movie (though there is no Bing singing White Christmas in this one) marketed for the druggie generation of post-teens and those in their late 20s, that is perhaps a cut above the rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland&#39;s largest share of ticket buyers, as it tells its somewhat derivative black comic tale, (PULP FICTION type dialogue and style), fuelled by the originality of its accelerated pace, using the cool life-style in LALA land as its backdrop, and telling about its main characters who either work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing pills.\nGO is made up of three interconnected stories, which are told in different versions from the point where Ronna (Polley ), as the supermarket cashier strapped for rent money, about to be evicted on Christmas Eve, is on the phone, as her fellow supermarket cashier, the Britisher, Simon (Desmond), who needs to go to Las Vegas with his mates, makes Ronna an offer, giving her his pay up front, if she takes his shift at work.\nThe first story is about Ronna, who shows some spunk, interacting with her fellow workers by playing a funny kind of guess the celebrity game while on a break, but is quickly dislodged into reality when the manager tells her the break is over, and she is back at work filling in for Simon, after finishing her 14- hour shift. In this frenetically paced film, the innovative young director, Doug Liman, following his indie debut feature, SWINGERS, shows that he has a feel for these young people and their problematic world, as he grapples with their realities, giving us a good look at how they view themselves, their job and their customers. On Ronna&#39;s check out line are two good-looking guys, appearing to be swish, to the dismay of one of Ronna&#39;s cashier girlfriends, Claire (Katie), as these two, Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr), ask for Simon, and quickly let on that he is their drug supplier, while telling Ronna they will deal with her because they need the stuff, immediately, for a party. This gives Ronna some ideas that she can do the deal herself by going to Simon&#39;s supplier, Todd (Olyphant); but, he tells her she needs all the money up front to make the deal. From there on, what can go wrong for her, does. The most amusing bit, is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill, at a party, where those who are there, are so high already, they don&#39;t know the difference from one pill to the other.\nThe second story is one that I must have seen a dozen times by now in films, about the guys who go to Vegas, gamble over their head, get into trouble, have a car chase, meet some gangsters and Vegas showgirls, and have themselves a vacation they can&#39;t forget. What saves this story is not the story, but the charm of the hapless Simon in Vegas, and the mood set by the glitzy Vegas world of neon, that blends violence in with the loud background music, as the bouncers chase after Simon and his friends, all because Simon put his hands on a lap dancer and wounded the bouncer who was pummeling him. But it is the very likable nature of Simon&#39;s amusing friends, as they chatter away, one conversation has the white Tiny (Breckin) telling the black Marcus (Taye), that race is a state of mind, other conversations include one about Tantric sex, that saves the day in Vegas.\nThe third and final story traces Adam and Zack, the two TV actors and lovers, who got busted and are now wired to catch other drug offenders, such as Simon and Ronna, with the promise by the weird undercover officer in charge of them (Fichtner), that if they cooperate, they will be let completely off the hook. I though Fichtner was the funniest and most malevolent one in the film.\nI don&#39;t think the film had much to say about much of anything, including the use of drugs, but it hit hard at being an hilarious film, with its fast-paced mood swings, its sharp editing cuts and frequent light changes, allowing its story to be easy to watch, and imbuing the characters with a certain attitude about them, that made their performances seem eclectic. I especially liked Sarah Polley, when she wasn&#39;t on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose.\nIn any case, GO has watch ability because of its raw energy, and the way it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high. Yet the film for all its innovative features, still could not escape, from being on the edge of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking. And the only reason for calling it a Christmas story, is because it happens during the holiday season, probably accurately showing how some generation x&#39;ers now spend their holidays. The film&#39;s appeal is still mostly with the younger generation. They are the ones who are mostly likely to be amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves, while the older generations might not be as amused, and feel put off by the lack of any character depth or real wit in the story. And the benign ending, not only didn&#39;t make sense, but seemed artificial and embarrassing to watch. It was as if this film after using all its energy in rebellion, now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending.\nREVIEWED ON 4/25/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;MATRIX, THE (directors: Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski; cast: Keanu Reeves (Neo/Thomas Anderson), Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), Gloria Foster (Oracle), Joe Pantoliano (Cypher), Marcus Chong (Tank), 1999)\nHow do you like to see Christ depicted in films? The Wachowski brothers, refugees from Marvel comic books, with one critically acclaimed lesbian noir type of film under their belt, BOUND, have chosen a guy who works for a legitimate software company by day, Thomas Anderson (Reeves), but at night works feverishly alone in his room, as a hacker, known as Neo, who has broken every law in the book against computer misuse. The Wachowski brothers must think they hit upon something really important to convey, because in my book, any film that goes way over two hours in length, thinks of itself as important, and by earmarking the young literate computer age audience to buy into their intellectual sci-fi\&#39;er, as they flatter them by telling them that it is only at a young age that one can develop the ability to have a chance of understanding the message delivered here, they have done just that, making me wonder how they expect adults to react to their film.\nAnd the Good News the film brings, is that &#34;The One&#34; is alive, as prophesized in the Bible. Here he is just disguised as a regular person, and he is a hacker. He will soon learn of an evil force out there, called The Matrix, that not everyone is aware of, that is an all-encompassing virtual-reality program overseen by omnipotent computers. As the filmmakers get involved in their little pseudo-philosophy game of what\&#39;s real and what isn\&#39;t, promising those with an open mind a chance to be unplugged, to find out what is real. I think, they really believe they will get unplugged, mainly, because they had the good sense to pay money to see the movie.\nWhat the Wachowski brothers are good at is style and visuals, and what we see on screen is ground breaking fun to watch, in the form of exhilarating camera work from the opening sequence onwards, as a mixture of Kung-Fu and sci-fi schmaltz is used, which is as entertaining as it is ominously intellectually pretentious, as a computer hacker named Trinity (Moss), she is a take off on Mary Magdalene, which is why there is no sex between her and Neo, just intent eye contact, as she uses her Kung-Fu and super-natural skills, just like its done in the comics, to escape from a police trap, that comes by way of info an informer gave them. Arriving on the scene, just a bit late, are the ultra serious and menacing Agents, created from artificial intelligence, skilled in Kung-Fu, clad in uniforms of dark suits and sunglasses, led by Agent Smith (Hugo), who is well aware of the group that Trinity belongs to, and is optimistic that he will get that renegade group and their leader Morpheus (Fishburne), who is depicted as a John the Baptist type. The police informer has, also, tipped them off about a hacker named Neo, who is about to be recruited into Morpheus\&#39;s group, so the action now swings into the police\&#39;s capture of Neo, and we see how they bug him, and I mean literally bug him, and when he escapes from the police, it is just as thrilling to see how Morpheus\&#39;s crew debugs him.\nThe action scenes are the virtue in this movie, when we get to see Morpheus, on board his time-traveling hovercraft USS Nebuchadnezzar, with his small crew of believers, he being depicted as the true believer, who blindly believes in what he is doing is best for the world, we are in pedantic trouble, at this jucture of the film, as we all must be lectured to. All that talk, all those explanations, every bit of pseodo- philosophical occultism is pulled out of the hat to make the story plausible, except the more rationally it is explained by the group\&#39;s leader, Morpheus, the more holes in his story are opened up, and the Judas in his group, who only wants to return to the matrix, in his old job at the factory, is tired of all this hype after nine years of eating the same slop, is played by Cypher (Joe), now eating a juicy steak with the Agents and declaring ignorance is bliss, seems to make as much sense as the mumbo-jumbo Morpheus is talking about. As Morpheus explains all this to Neo, who believe me, if you just take one look at him, no one in his right mind would mistake him for even one second, as &#34;The One.&#34; But Morpheus is convinced he is &#34;The One,&#34; as he fills his head with programs a young and up-and-coming Christ needs, no more pacifism here, but plenty of Kung-Fu warrior stuff, as he prepares to take him to the oracle for a private consultation. Evidently, she has insights into things even the true believers and the next Christ don\&#39;t even know. At last, a voice in appreciation for the muses, arises.\nThis is a high tech movie, whose action scenes are for the most part humorless, notwithstanding the facile ideas it throws in, as this film\&#39;s playful gestures come about as the chase takes place between the bad guys who can\&#39;t die, as depicted on screen with splendid computer imagery, as we see those who represent the unnamed governments, in this unnamed city, as lawful Agents, try to round up this group of hackers, who also can\&#39;t die, until all those action scenes get surplanted by the very human and humorous scene of Neo and the oracle, played with grace and dignity, by Gloria Foster, as he asks her if he is Christ, as she tells him, if you are in love, you don\&#39;t need anyone to tell you that.\nSo now we have a hero who has doubts, he has already learned from Morpheus that the world he is living in is false, but he can\&#39;t return to normalcy, because he chose the red pill instead of the blue pill, that Morpheus so dramatically gave him, when he told him that there is no going back once you choose the kind of world you want to live in. And now he is stuck searching for the truth. I don\&#39;t think he even has time to go out and see an escapist sci-fi film, just for kicks. It is serious business saving the world, with not many people even willing to thank you for your effort. But he, at least, found Morpheus, the one he was searching for, but as an interesting twist in the story, it was Morpheus who was looking for him. So the two have found each other, and now the rest of the story has to be played out as it is written, or does man have free will to make his own destiny?\nYou will only get questions in this film, not answers. But one of the questions is, from what source do the questions come from, and that is answered in an interview with the directors, I read in the film \&#39;zine, American Cinematographer, as the Wachowski brothers freely talked about what kind of film they were trying to make and who influenced them.\nThe film ends with Neo, looking like Clark Kent, as he is stepping out of a telephone booth, to give the film the full comic book flavor it deserves, as if Superman is there, already in place, ready to stop the bad guys. For the film\&#39;s point of reference to anything resembling theology and theory, it was Jean Baudrillard\&#39;s Simulacra and Simulation that was used as reference material, referring to his take on Ecclessiastics. That was the book Neo had in his room when his computer friends came by to pick up their pirated program. He is the modern French philospher, with his theories of time as unreal and his critique of hyperreality and how the truth can\&#39;t be reached, but violence can, that influenced the Wachowski brothers in the making of this film.\nBut even more than a Biblical film (though if you are looking for this to be a spiritual film, there are plenty of symbols in the film to allude to this being so), or another look at the world of Lewis Carroll\&#39;s Alice in Wonderland, this is a computer-age film, that questions if we have just become batteries for our computers, who have evolved past us in their knowledge of the world. And the questions of who we are abound, as Neo is now free of the illusions he has lived with, as he wonders how he will handle this new found experience. And the only intellectual question we may be left to ask ourselves, if we take the new myth presented here seriously, is who needs Christ when we got Superman, or do we need neither or both, or do we just need Christ ?\nREVIEWED ON 4/26/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34; Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#34;THE PIED PIPER (director: Jacques Demy; cast: Donald Pleasence (The Baron), John Hurt (Franz), Jack Wild (Gavin), Donovan (Pied Piper), Cathyrn Harrison (Lisa), Michael Hordern (Melius), Peter Vaughan (Bishop), Keith Buckley (Mattio), Roy Kinnear (Burgermeister), 1972-GB)\nThis version of THE PIED PIPER is not exactly told as a children&#39;s fable, retelling the Robert Browning poem of the piper (Donovan) who rids Hamelin of its rats, as this English speaking film placed in the able hands of the French director, Jacques Demy, reveals a gripping story of evil in the Middle-Ages, a time when 75 million people across Europe died of the plague, as he tells of the corrupted church and local town administrators, working in cahoots, as their maniacal plans coincide to support a papal war in Italy and for the town to build a huge cathedral for itself, all this in the midst of the bubonic plague of 1349, which the church interpreted as part of God&#39;s master plan.\nWe are in Northern Germany and a caravan of Gypsy performers, led by Mattio (Keith), stops to pick up a musician (Donovan), as they try to reach Hamelin for the wedding celebration between the lordly Franz (Hurt) and Lisa (Cathyrn), the wealthy burgermeister&#39;s fourteen year old daughter, but are refused entry to the city because of fear that they might be carriers of the plague. In the hamlet, Lisa is in a coma. A delegation of clergy is there to give her the last rites, but the burgermeister summons, as a last resort, the aid of the town&#39;s outcast, the Jewish alchemist, Melius (Hordern), who states the girl is not going to die, she doesn&#39;t have the plague, but needs rest and music. The church delegates leave in a huff, accusing the Jew of causing the plague and dabbling in work that goes against God&#39;s will. Soon a piper&#39;s soothing music, coming from outside the gates of the hamlet is heard, as it revives the young girl, encouraging the burgermeister to summon the piper, who tells the messengers sent to retrieve him, that he will not enter unless his Gypsy friends can also enter the hamlet.\nGavin (Wild) is the crippled helper of Melius, idolizing him, looking to him for paternal advise and wisdom. He is in love with Lisa, who is a few years younger than he is, but is helpless to stop the marriage of the very evil, self-serving Franz, who appears to be a man in his 30s, who does not love Lisa, but insists on the marriage as a means of getting a dowry from her family, money that his family dearly needs. Lisa is just a little girl, who doesn&#39;t seem capable of loving anyone, at this point of her life.\nThe baron is evilly played by Donald Pleasence, who has taxed his subjects to the limit and now must devise ways to get more money for his fiefdom. Franz devises a plan for the pope to have his soldiers for war, by forcing the alchemist to come up with gilded gold, which the baron will use to give to the hamlet&#39;s teenagers, so that they will be enticed into joining the pope&#39;s army in Italy, while their fathers stay home to build the baron&#39;s cathedral. Thereby, the pope, having gotten the soldier&#39;s from town, will supply the rest of the money needed to finish the cathedral.\nAt the wedding celebration, the rats are present everywhere, scaring the town to death. The piper offers to get rid of the rats, if the burgermeister gives him 1,000 guildas. When the piper plays his tune, and the rats all march out of the town and are drowned in the river, the burgermeister, foolishly and greedily thinking that the crisis from the rats causing the black plague is over, reneges on his promise to the piper. As a result, the piper plays his tune, and all the children, including Lisa, leave with the piper, disappearing with him to wherever he is leading them to. The only one who can&#39;t make it, is the crippled Gavin, who leaves town with the Gypsyies, since his mentor was burnt at the stake by the church inquisitors.\nThis version of Browning&#39;s poem is well-told and sensible, and probably a lot like he meant it to be conveyed, but somehow it looks flat on screen, like it was a B movie, and this is surprising, since Demy is really a great director. But, evidently, something went terribly wrong here. The film is so flatly done, it was as if I was watching the machine-like actors go through the motions of acting out a chilling story, that when it came out on screen had lost its chills, even if the story itself remained chilling.\nREVIEWED ON 4/24/99\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#34;,
 &#39;THE APOSTLE (director: Robert Duvall; cast: Robert Duvall, Miranda Richardson, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley, Walter Goggins, Rick Dial, Billy Joe Shaver, Billy Bob Thornton, June Carter Cash, Todd Allen, 1997)\nThis is Duvall\&#39;s movie through and through, the one he had to make, the one that crawled in his blood, the one movie that he prepared his entire life for, where he has a role that fits him to a tee. He did everything in this picture, including back it with his money. As for me, I\&#39;m not partial to these Pentecostal preachers and their heavy handed, pushy methods of self-righteousness. To watch a movie, which almost imitates a church service in length and purpose, is not particularly entertaining or spiritual for my tastes. What this film does very well, is examine the character of the man preaching, and what affect religion has on the people. In this case, it was mostly poor black southerners who attended his services.\nDuvall is Sonny, the apostle. He is a flawed character, who got the calling to preach when he was 12, and has been doing the lord\&#39;s work ever since (oh my...!). He is basically a good hearted guy, with a bit of a temper, and a strong belief that God communicates with him. If we didn\&#39;t live in a society where so many folks think like him and mistakeningly and arrogantly take the letter of the bible as gospel, then he would be considered a certifiable nut case. What makes him more interesting than, let\&#39;s say, a Billy Graham, that holier than thou evangelist, the friend of presidents, is that he has the ability to get hot and pick up a baseball bat against the head of the guy who stole his wife (Farrah) and kids. As a result of this incident, he has to flee Texas. In any case, Farrah has grown tired of his traveling act, always on the road preaching and womanizing, and had lost her love for him.\nWhat Duvall has is zeal, he is a non-stop talker, always railing on about Jesus and satan, quoting scriptures, offering up the whole evangelical bag of tricks. That he is good at it, is not the question. That he is annoying, except to those who need to be with someone like him, someone who is demonstrative in his praise of God, someone who can make them feel good about themselves, even if they are a sinner and a lost soul, is another thing. All he asks for them is to believe in a personal God, Jesus. His mind-set is programed, never getting off the Jesus wavelength. This guy would be a real bore at a party, or a hellish parent to a child who is a free thinker.\nSonny lands on his feet in Bayou country, in a small Lousiana town, where he talks a respected black pastor (Beasely) into backing him in getting a small church. He wins the pastor over with his ability to preach. He is now going under the name E.F., hiding his identity from the police who are looking for him. He stirs up a little romance with a radio station receptionist (Miranda). These unevangelical moments, of him on a date with her, talking real talk, were gems, and these scenes made the film a more enjoyable experience. It was fun to watch Duvall try to handle himself with the lady, who was considerably younger than his late 60ish age, and who was somewhat stand-offish of him, yet at the same time was fascinated by him. It was revealing that he couldn\&#39;t talk about himself introspectively to her, everything revolved around his God, it was as if he was not totally there, devoid of a magnetic personality off stage. It was also fun to watch Duvall smile, because as good an actor as he is, and he is one of the good ones, his friendly smile always has a trace of cruelty around the edges. It seems he can only play parts where he is all wired up, frenetically moving in every scene.\nIn this film, he has created a work that tries to be more than entertaining, reaching for a more artistic film. It seems as if he was born to preach. As for me, I live not to be preached to. What made the picture dull for me, is the subject matter. But what excites me about this film, is that I believe it has a truth to it, that can\&#39;t be denied; and that, Duvall has accomplished a virtuoso performance, supported by some excellent actors in supporting roles and non-professional actors giving the film an intimacy and a flavor to it that is special.\nREVIEWED ON 1/29/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LE CERCLE ROUGE (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Alain Delon (Corey), Gian Maria Volonté (Vogel), Yves Montand (Jansen), André Bourvil (Mattei), François Périer (Santi), André Ekyan (Rico), 1970-France)\nThis is a noir film, one of the last one\&#39;s shot that can truly emulate the spirit of the one\&#39;s shot in the heyday of American noir, in the 40s and the 50s. Melville shoots in a dark color tone, that sets the dire mood of the violent story about a prison escape, a heist, a double-cross, and the untrustworthy nature of people. Melville wanted to make a French version of John Huston\&#39;s noir classic, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (50), as Melville imbued in his film his strong beliefs about what a gangster picture should look like, making it original while covering all the subplots of that genre he could manage to fit into a film that runs for 150 minutes. This is a transitional film, as it makes way for a new wave of crime films to follow, one\&#39;s that will reflect the changing mores of society and the changes within the criminal code that the new decade brings with it.\nCorey (Delon) is a steely-eyed hood, who is being released from prison tomorrow, when he breaks into the cell of another prisoner, Vogel (Volonté), to tell him that he can arrange to help him escape tomorrow if he agrees to join him in a heist he has planned. Vogel escapes from a moving train, as a massive police hunt is on the way for his capture, led by the fair-haired Corsican, Superintendent Mattei (Bourvil), who is quite an interesting character, as well as being a cat-lover, whose boss, the police commissioner, while pressing him to do everything possible to get Vogel, lectures him that every man is guilty, something that slowly sinks into Mattei\&#39;s consciousness as his investigation broadens.\nWhile the escape is taking place, Corey goes back to Marseilles to get money from his crime boss Rico (Ekyan), who tries to put him off, so Corey robs him, causing Rico to send a couple of his gang members after him, who end up getting shot by Vogel, who by this time has joined Corey in the car he just bought with Rico\&#39;s money. The intense action scenes amidst the changing weather from rain to snow, plus the wooded area and the roadblocks the men must cross to get back to Paris, gives the film an air of resolute desperation, that is intriguing to watch, as each camera shot is done by the hands of a master, reaching far into his characters and their surroundings.\nTo help with the jewel heist,Vogel suggests a friend of his, a former police marksman who cracked up from the pressure of the job, Jansen (Yves), who is first seen having a nightmare that bugs are attacking him, that is very movingly shot, and is framed like it is a painting on canvas by one of the master\&#39;s of horror painting, someone like a Francis Bacon. Bunuel has very effectively used surreal shots like this in some of his films.\nThe heist of the Place Vendome is excuted in silence for the 30- odd minutes it takes to pull off the job. There are five men involved in this jewel heist, these three plus a tip-off man and the fence. But when the robbery is completed, the fence backs out because he is pressured to by a local gangster, Santi (Périer), who is a nightclub owner and pimp, and a one time informant for Mattei, who leans heavily on him to cooperate in this case. For Mattei, there is no such thing as police without informers. This relationship made in hell, makes no one an innocent.\nThe film\&#39;s conclusion is as violent as it has to be, since the mood was set from the film\&#39;s onset to end this way. By this time, we know all the character\&#39;s rather well, as we see who turns on the other, and how hypertense a policeman\&#39;s job is, with not that much sanity separating his job from the criminal\&#39;s.\nThis is a top notch noir film. It has done an outstanding job in uncovering the themes of alienation and desperation, that drive men so hard that it is impossible for them to transcend their criminal nature.\nREVIEWED ON 4/27/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34; Ozus World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;SECOND BREATH, THE (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Lino Ventura (Gus), Paul Meurisse (Inspector Bleu), Raymond Pellegrin (Paul Ricci), Christine Fabr=E9ga (Manouche), Marcel Bozzuffi (Joe Ricci), Raymond Loyer (Jacques le notaire), Paul Frankeur (Inspector), Pierre Zimmer (Karloff), 1966-France)\nAn intricate film noir, about a hardened criminal, Gus (Lino), who escapes after serving 16- years on a murder charge, and returns to his hometown in Marseilles, to make contact with his sister, Manouche (Fabr=E9ga), and get revenge on a crime boss, Joe Ricci (Bozzuffi), who double-crossed him. It is filmed with calm detachment, in black-and- white, giving the film a taut look, as the action is sharp and ruthless, by men who are all business.\nGus is a troubled, desperate 46-year-old, snake-bitten his whole life, he now needs some fast money and another country to go to. But first, while visiting his sister, he runs into a couple of mobsters trying to shake her down, as he disposes of them, he learns of the hit done by Joe Ricci, against Jacques le notaire (Loyer), his sister\&#39;s friend, which took place in his sister\&#39;s bar. All this is done in order to frighten Manouche, so that Joe Ricci can get her out of business.\nInspector Bleu (Meurisse) investigates the crime in Manouche\&#39;s bar, suspecting that Gus is hiding out with his sister\&#39;s help. In fact, he shows himself to be very perceptive about what is going on among the various crime gangs in Marseilles, as he begins laying a trap to catch Gus, his main concern, at the moment.\nPaul Ricci (Pellegrin) is at this time planning a Brink\&#39;s heist of a million dollar platinum shipment, and he needs 4 men to do the job, but one of the men dies. He asks Karloff (Zimmer) in on the job, but he declines because it involves killing two motorcycle cops, but he recommends Gus to him. Since Gus considers Paul to be the good Ricci brother, he goes along with the heist. The success of the heist in Paris, brings Inspector Bleu there, suspecting Gus is in on that job. He gets lucky back in Marseilles and spots Gus walking in the street, and by having his cops pose as a rival gang, claiming Paul double-crossed them, he uses the trickery of a tape recorder to get the unsuspecting Gus to talk about the heist, who names Paul as the front man.\nGus would rather die than be thought of as a squealer, and the last part of the film becomes increasingly violent and filled with desperation, as he escapes from the police and goes after the men he believes are betraying him.\nIt is interesting to see how Melville could make a low level hood like Gus, into a seemingly ethical person, that is, within the standards of the criminal mind, and be deemed as an almost sympathetic and, at the same time, pathetic figure, whose crime spree, though unforgiveable, will nevertheless, offer us something about him that is redeeming, that even the wily Inspector Bleu recognizes. This is not great noir, because the acting seemed jarred, but it has a certain tension in it that sustains its somber mood.\nREVIEWED ON 4/28/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LA FEMME NIKITA (director: Luc Bresson; cast: Anne Parillaud, Jean-Hughes Anglade, Tcheky Karyo, Jean Reno, Jeanne Moreau, 1990-Fr.)\nAn exciting and entertaining actioner that tests the plausibility of its story with an unreality check, yet is real on its emotional levels, testing the heroine\&#39;s reactions to love, guilt, loss of identity, and a deprived upbringing, which is rare for this genre to be so concerned with actual human values. Anne, the wife of Luc, plays Nikita with a flair, exhibiting the tremendous energy and orneriness needed to make the part exceptional. The film plays like an MTV special, using a splash of coloring to light up the screen and very fast paced action sequences to keep you mindlessly glued to the screen. But that is disarming, since this film has more than that to offer, even if it does not seem so during certain stretches of the film. It is worth sticking with this film, it gets better and less predictable the more you get into it. Though its ending, does leave a lot to be desired.\nNikita is a violent junkie, who gets caught in a bloody robbery, gets a life sentence, and is turned over to the government so she could train to be an agent for them, doing the dirty work they have to do for them, such as assassinations. This part of the story lags, as we watch how this violent misfit channels her anti-social aggressiveness into acceptibility for her new role in life, one that society, supposedly, can appreciate. Her teacher is Bob (Tcheky), who falls for her, but plays it on the up-and-up, remaining dedicated to the government he works for, never questioning their ruthless and unethical tactics. As we can easily surmise, she proves herself fit for her assignment, and the big event will climax on how she will fare on her first job.\nJeanne Moreau has a nice little cameo in Nikita\&#39;s schooling scenes, teaching the 23-year-old, how to be a woman. There is one great scene where we see the young Nikita putting on makeup next to Moreau, and we are dazzled by looking at the faces of the two stars fill-up the screen, with Moreau, wrinkles and all, still looking quite sexy and alluring, and in my way of looking at things, the one who is the more alluring.\nWith Nikita\&#39;s graduation from school, she is now a secret agent, who will answer to the code name Josephine, as she is given money to set up an apartment and life of her own, since the government has done a mock funeral for her, and she has no relations who will ask questions about her, she is now completely reborn as a new person. She quickly meets a checker in a supermarket, Mario (Anglade), and they fall in love and move in together. She remains mute to him about her biography, demanding that he asks her no questions, as she continues to go on hit man assignments for the government, in a seemingly never-ending redemption for her past crimes.\nHer final assignment goes awry, as a cleaner, Victor (Reno), is called in to mop up after the important mission, of going into an ambassador\&#39;s safe to steal documents that will link some private companies to some shady dealings, is about to be aborted. Victor is menacing , brutal, and maniacal, and this outcome of mayhem, convinces Nikita that it is time for her to move on.\nSo, we have come full cycle, and Nikita has developed an appreciation for life that she never had before, leaving us with much moral fodder to chew on, more than most actioners leave us with, and we come to the understanding that this incredible story, that is hardly plausible, that is seemingly cartoonish, is much better than it appears on surface because somehow or other it satisfies our need to know something about covert operations and the people who go into it on a non-voluntary basis, plus the movie is very entertaining and was able to hold our attention, even through the rough spots in it.\nREVIEWED ON 12/27/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;COOKIE\&#39;S FORTUNE (director: Robert Altman; cast: Glenn Close (Camille Dixon), Julianne Moore (Cora Duvall), Liv Tyler (Emma Duvall), Chris O\&#39;Donnell (Jason Brown), Charles S. Dutton (Willis Richland), Patricia Neal (Jewel Mae &#34;Cookie&#34; Orcutt), Ned Beatty (Lester Boyle), Courtney B. Vance (Otis Tucker), Donald Moffat (Jack Palmer), Lyle Lovett (Manny Hood), Ruby Wilson (Josie Martin), Danny Darst (Billy), Matt Malloy (Eddie, the expert), 1999)\nWhen I look at the deep south, the first thing that comes to my mind is their history of racial problems. In the sleepy town of Hollis Springs, Mississippi, much of the town is registered as a landmark in historical memories, as Altman gently moves his camera across the various personalities who live there, it is as if each one is an archetype specially depicted for this comic/drama story, and the town stands out in the background as a reminder of the past.\nFirstly, we look in on the local police, the dreaded bigots from the days of segregation, as we see them appear as forbearing as they always do, as they leave their stationhouse before going on patrol, but we will see later on that this is an integrated force now and a more amiable one, then the camera takes us to a black bar, where we hear the rich sounds of the blues being belted out in the wee morning hours, by a sultry Josie (Ruby), and then we switch over to the white folks, putting on a rehearsal for an Oscar Wilde Easter play about John the Baptist, at the Presbyterian Church, with the drama being directed by the intractably arrogant Camille (Close), with her not too talented younger sister Cora (Moore), being unduly manipulated by her, as she is being coached for her lead role of Salome. These two scenes contrast how the blacks and whites of Hollis Springs spend their evenings.\nNext, we follow Willis (Dutton), who is the soul of this film, standing for trust and reconciliation with the past, as he drunkingly walks out of the black bar and heads across town, passing a van with the sleeping Emma (Liv) inside, who just returned from leaving town over something that frustrated her, but is back now working for Manny (Lyle), gutting catfish, his love for her being a one way street, as he acts like a Peeping Tom, hovering around her van. Finally, we see Willis break into the house of an old rich white lady, Cookie (played with charm and crackling wit by veteran actress Patricia Neal, who rarely makes a film appearance anymore), but it turns out these two are the best of friends, and he only came by to clean her guns at one in the morning, since he promised her he would do it that evening, as he looks after her ever since her husband Buck died a few years ago; and, he also wants to tell her that her daughter (Emma) is back in town. We will later on learn, as it is one of the town\&#39;s well-kept secrets, that she is actually the 18-year-old daughter of Cora.\nWhat Altman has done, is paint a picture of the town, full of local flavor, trying to test us to see if we guessed right at what our first impressions of the locals was, as those of us who have not kept up with the changes in the south or have not been brought up there, might view things from an outdated way of seeing the new south, thinking the worst of them, but now surprised to find that the only thing that has not changed about our perceptions of the south, is how dull witted some of them can still be.\nAltman\&#39;s other aims are to uncover all the town\&#39;s little nasty secrets that is so easily hidden by its southern hospitality and history of racism. Though, the tone of Altman\&#39;s film is always light and never very haunting. This is one of his mild films, he doesn\&#39;t penetrate deeper than the story itself takes us, even if it is tightly directed, with no visible flaws in the storyline and the film\&#39;s purpose, everything about it turns out to be as pleasing as the smell of magnolias in the spring, and thereby we are cheated into seeing something that could have been most revealing, instead we are offered something that is really too bland and simplistic for its own good, even if it is a satisfying film, it is still most easily categorized into the &#34;feel good&#34; type of mold, something Altman might have winced at in his heyday of filmmaking in the 70s.\nThe climactic scene revolves around Cookie\&#39;s desire to join her husband in the afterworld, since life has no meaning for her without him, as she is only living for her memories of him, therefore she shoots herself, leaving a suicide note for Willis, but unfortunately her diabolical Aunt Camille, who comes over for a fruit bowl, finds her body and eats the suicide note while stealing worthless trinkets from the house, and then telling Cora, that this wasn\&#39;t a suicide, only insane people kill themselves, and no one in our family is insane, as she takes the gun out of Cookie\&#39;s hand and throws it into a flower bed, and has Cora call the police, while reminding her to tell them it was a robbery and murder, supposedly covering up the suicide to protect their cherished family name.\nUnfortunately, the good-hearted Willis becomes a suspect because his fingerprints are all over the house and on all the guns. What is comical or tragic, depending on what kind of a sense of humor you have, is watching how the crime scene is being trampled on, and the murder investigation done in such an amateurish way, that the investigators of the little Jon Benet Ramsey murder in Boulder, Colorado, would look like Scotland Yard investigators in comparison to this sheriff\&#39;s department.\nThere is a love story played out by Emma and Jason (Chris), who is the junior member of the police department. Their romance is a series of lustful encounters, that is mostly comical, as it adds to the story, by giving it a more local flavoring.\nAs far as the police go, they don\&#39;t think Willis did it, but they hold him in an unlocked cell and play scrabble with him, while he puts all his trust in them to uncover the truth. Now this is as far a cry from the old Mississippi, as one can imagine, though there are still some lingering subtle racial prejudices around. But the best argument given for why Willis couldn\&#39;t have done the crime, is given by the sheriff, Lester (Ned), who says, &#34; Because I went Fishing with him.&#34; Which, I guess, could best be understood as a very logical statement by those who were brought up in a small-town.\nThe film ends on Cora\&#39;s spiteful comment to her sister, as she sticks to the story her controlling sister gave her, that it wasn\&#39;t a suicide, as she triumphantly exclaims, &#34; I did good, didn\&#39;t I ?&#34;\nThe film\&#39;s decency shines through all the past racial injustices, and maybe things are getting better in the south, at least that is the message we are left with, and I see no reason to be of a different opinion. But that last framed shot of the sheriff and Emma and the lawyer and Willis sitting on the dock fishing was a little too rosy a picture for me to take in all at once.\nCookie\&#39;s Fortune turns out to be in the unlocking of the past by the revelation about heritage and parenthood for the family members of Cookie Orcutt. Trying to come to terms with the past is something the south, as well as the rest of the country, is still hopefully working on. Race relations might be the biggest problem Americans are still faced with, and finding a cordial way out of it is the aim of a lot of good folks. The weakness of this film, is that its over-all decency is not moving enough of an experience to make this anything but a mildly entertaining film, that captured a little something about the south\&#39;s past and future, and made us feel a little better that we saw it, but did not set off any bigger sparks, or really create any excitement about the town or its inhabitants that is worth taking note of.\nREVIEWED ON 5/1/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;IDIOTERNE (director: Lars von Trier; cast: Bodil Jørgensen (Karen), Jens Albinus (Stoffer), Anne Louise Hassing (Susanne), Troels Lyby (Henrik), Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Jeppe), Henrik Prip (Ped), Luis Mesonero (Miguel), Louise Mieritz (Josephine), Knud Romer Jorgensen (Axel), Katrine Michelsen (Nana), Anders Hove (Josephine\&#39;s Father), 1998-Denmark)\nThis is the first film made under the label of Dogma, a Scandinavian film group inspired by the Danish director von Trier, which insists that their new manifesto on how to make films, be adhered to by those who make films under their label.\nThis dogma consists of improvised acting and hand-held camera work, among other dogmas the film must adhere to. It reminds me most of how Godard filmed during his Mao stage, but without the apparent overt political messages, as Godard\&#39;s films during the late 60s were anti-film films, replete with diatribes against the bourgeoisie, which seemed filled with the director\&#39;s hubris and self-congratulation on his political stance, that he was right and others wrong in their beliefs, and his rather tiresome political cliches, that seemed to be more opportunistic than spontaneous, even though every attempt was to make the film appear as if they were spontaneous.\nTrier has a bunch of middle-class cult groupies living together in a rich private house that one of their relatives gave them, as the group members seem to be either in their late teens or their 20s, whose repulsive purpose is to freak out in public and sometimes do it when together in the privacy of their house. To spasse, is a Danish term, which refers to those who act like idiots even though they are not. These episodes of spassing give this film an odd look that is guaranteed to turn off a lot people and anger many, especially those who expect more conventional ways of looking at the problems young people face in society.\nThe theme of the movie is certainly obnoxious, it is very difficult to feel much of anything for these middle-class drop-outs, as we first encounter them in action in an elegant restaurant and watch them spasse, retardedly eating their food, under the direction of one of them (Susanne), who pretends to be their keeper, while one of them, Stoffer, grabs on to a lady (Karen), sitting alone, and refuses to let go of her. Karen seems to be responding kindly to the idiot, just like she didn\&#39;t react with any ill emotion after being treated rather brusquely by the waiter when she told him she doesn\&#39;t have much money and will be just ordering the salad. The group leaves together with Karen and tells her it is just a game they enjoy playing, inviting her to join them, even though she does not appear like they do, but she does look desperate and lonely and unhappy, and might benefit from hanging around with such idiots as they are.\nThey do another spassing in a Rockwood furniture factory, which was more stupid than humorous and belabored any point that was trying to be made about workers in a factory or about middle-class values, it was goofy in a way to watch them operate, as it seemed to be similar to the way that fraternities might find their inane initiation rites uplifting to their older members who already went through the initiation process to join the group, but to outsiders it would seem like they were seeing a bunch of spoiled children.\nIn another public spassing, Jeppe is left by the one playing his keeper (Stoffer), with a burly looking bunch of tattooed, beer guzzling biker types, who are asked to mind him for ten minutes, after they notice Jeppe staring at their tattoos, while the keeper goes to the other part of the bar. Again, it was not funny, but yet, it was curiously interesting, in a prurient kind of way to see what the interaction was going to be between these two groups of outcasts.\nThe most controversial part of the film is the sex orgy among the group members, acting as idiots, and actually seeming to copulate on camera (porno stars were used to do the sex), sort of giving the film a mock documentary feel to it, as the orgy members smear caviar all over their faces, and try to unbend from the middle-class environment they all came out of. The tenderest love making was between the teenager Josephine and the older Jeppe, who really seemed to be falling for each other, but could only do it under the cover of being idiots. Soon Josephine\&#39;s father would embarrass her by coming to the group\&#39;s home and removing her from the home.\nThe film moved into the gist of the filmmaker\&#39;s message when Stoffer, the leader of the group, decided he would spin a bottle and whomever was chosen would have to spasse in front of family members or those they previously worked with. Axel and Henrik could not do it and thereby left the group. What was becoming increasingly clear was that the game was almost over for all of them, that they couldn\&#39;t really confront the idiot inside themselves, that it was becoming apparent to them, that it was just a temporary game they were playing, perhaps, in an experimental phase of their young life.\nI think the point that von Trier was trying to make, is that you really have to be an idiot to change the system, or think that you can change it, but that you can only be effective when you really confront who you are, reaching past the point of where authority rules who you are; or else, you are stuck with the same cultural values you have always had and can\&#39;t really change who you have been brought up as. Being an idiot is the last act of despair. It is an act of courage. And it only matters when you can do it for real and not be using it to play a game. For von Trier, being an idiot is an endearing way at looking at someone acting out who he is, in order to initiate change in the system.\nKaren\&#39;s story now unfolds; and, she turns out to be the one with the most dramatic thing to tell about her life. She volunteers to go back home to do her spassing with Susanne as her witness. We meet her family, who act cold towards her, asking her where she has been for the last two weeks, and wondering why she didn\&#39;t go to her baby\&#39;s funeral. We meet her husband, who shows her no love, and then we see her spasse on her cream cake after dinner, acting as her baby might have acted when eating the cake, and she gets slapped by her husband and leaves the house with Susanne, who is filled with genuine tears. The trauma for her has reached a point of no return, and the very dangers of spassing or regressing back to one\&#39;s childhood to find a way of dealing with a society you are antagonistic to, seems frought with extreme personal dangers, and the possiblity of a psychosis developing looms over all the young people\&#39;s heads.\nTrier has made his point. He has won me over. This very unusual personal film, that is very difficult to warm up to, that mocks what is conventionally thought of as right, by doing what is unconscionable and politically incorrect, becomes only too real and too sad to comprehend, as it is presented so as not to give us a way out in our perception of how to deal with the alienation the youngsters feel, as they seem to be left with only their naive hopes and disillusionments; and possibly, their emotional experiences that they can value. Their situation is not resolved. The film does not end with all loose ends tied up in a nice bow. We can\&#39;t even be sure how long their commune life will continue, and how soon it is that they will find themselves out in the cold world, alone again, as misfits, where some of them will fit in without too much trouble but will be living a lie; and, where others will find it very difficult to go back to being middle-class, and will always be restless in such a society. But they tried something... and whether they reached their inner-self or not, something penetrated them, whether they are the better for this experience, is difficult to tell, but something significant to them did take place, just as we in the audience, whether we liked the film or not, something inside us was moved by what we saw taking place, causing us to react in a way we might not normally act when watching a film; and, in my way of thinking, that is great filmmaking.\nREVIEWED ON 4/30/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34; Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;AGANTUK (director: Satyajit Ray; cast: Depankar De (Sudhindra Bose), Mamata Shankar (Anila Bose), Bikram Bannerjee (Satyaki Bose), Utpal Dutt (Manomohan Mitra), Dhritiman Chatterjee (Prithwish Sen Gupta), Robi Ghosh (Ranjan Rakshit), Ajit Bannerjee (Sital Sarkar), 1991-India)\nSatyajit Ray\&#39;s 28th and last film, he died in 1992, is one that he shot in radiant color, and is as close as you can come to being a masterpiece and not be one, it is much better than some of his recent films, which seemed to show his old-fashioned humanistic ideas of what a film should be like, to be in a decline with the modern theater goer\&#39;s taste.This film moved me a great deal, as I found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization.\nIn his swan song, it is very much apparent that the great film director has made this work very much autobiographical, speaking through the hermit visitor of a niece he has not seen in 35-years, seeing her last when she was only 2- years-old, as he returns to Calcutta, his place of birth, as an old man who is wizened for having traveled the world and for having lived among savages for most of his life.\nThe plot is rather plain. The great-uncle Mitra (Dutt), played with a certain grain of boldness and great wit and a fierce sense of humor and a proper restraint, writes in impeccable Bengali to his wealthy niece, Anila (Mamata), that he will visit her for one week and realizes the visit might come as a surprise to her, but wants to know if she can accept him and offer him the hospitality of a traditional Indian family visit. This causes concern for her husband Sudhindra (Depankar De), who is a successful and well-educated executive, as they fear he might be an imposter after their money, but yet they feel obligated to honor their traditional roles in life. Only their 11-year-old son Satyaki (Bikram) seems to be genuinely glad of the visit, and easily accepts him as his uncle, intrigued by his knowledge and generosity of spirit.\nWhen asked why he left his family and had no contact with them for all these years, he animatedly tells them, it was wanderlust and the bisons he saw painted on the caves by the savages before the age of civilization, this encouraged him to become an anthropologist and not a painter and live among the different tribal people of the world, he feels that no painter could learn the art better than the savages have. This makes Sudhindra more suspicious of him than before, as he thinks that he is certainly scholarly and articulate and well-travelled, but he might be this clever because he is really an impostor. So he devices several ways to trap the uncle into telling the truth, one by having the visitor show him his passport, which he readily does, and secondly, by having his trial savvy lawyer friend, Prithwish (Dhritiman), cross-examine him. The family has no other way of confirming in a hurry if this is really their uncle.\nThe confrontation between Prithwish, who is a defender of rationalism and science, but is primarily looking out for his friend\&#39;s interest, in finding out who this visitor really is, as he does his best to bring out the uncle\&#39;s beliefs in the virtues and superiority of the primitive culture, agreeing with him only that religion sets up barriers between people and causes more harm than it does good. But Prithwish is worn down after an evening of sharp conversations and badly deflated that his arguments don\&#39;t hold up that well, and embarrasses the family by leaving angrily and telling the uncle that he should either prove who he is or leave. While the uncle only seems more anxious after this exhausting talk to clear up some business he has to take care of and to get back to his tribal people, where he feels more comfortable than with the bourgeoisie.\nRay\&#39;s choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers, especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the Santhal Tribe, is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldn\&#39;t forget our roots.The opulence and warm-hearted nature of the film overcame the lack of real suspense the film had and its predictability. His light touch and simple human gestures with the camera, poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought, allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great director\&#39;s creative life, questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in, as he leaves us with this last eloquent film, one that has his signature firmly on it.\nREVIEWED ON 5/2/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LOVE IS THE DEVIL (director: John Maybury; Derek Jacobi (Francis Bacon), Daniel Craig (George Dyer), Tilda Swinton (Muriel Belcher), Anne Lambton (Isabel Rawsthorne), Adrian Scarborough (Daniel Farson), Karl Johnson (John Deakin), Annabel Brooks (Henrietta Moraes), 1998-UK)\nSimply put, the renown British artist, Francis Bacon (Jacobi), is not a very nice person. This is a true-to-life portrait of one of this century\&#39;s most celebrated artists, as the film covers his work from the periods of the 1960s- through the- 1970s, as Bacon\&#39;s specialty in the macabre is examined, as is also his spectacle of what is horrific, but the film offers very little concrete arguments for him to be considered as a great artist (we saw none of his paintings on display; I realize that this was no fault of the director, since Bacon\&#39;s estate refused to grant permission for their use).\nThat he is a great artist, is of course, a debatable subject; but what is not subject to debate, is the brilliant performance by Derek Jacobi (a virtuoso one) and the fine supporting performance by his lover who is the foil for all his nasty wit, Daniel Craig (George), as both exhibit a forcefulness and a subtly for their character that leaves no doubt that they have mastered their subject rather well, leaving no sharp stone unturned, so to speak.\nIn the very first shot, Bacon is diabolically smelling the pillow from an obvious lover who just left his flat, an image that reminded me so much of Hannibal Lecter in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and his extrasensory capacity for smell.\nSoon he is confronted with a crashing sound from his skylight flat and there is George Dyer, a lower-class London East Ender, a petty burglar who gets caught by Bacon as he is robbing his flat. They immediately become lovers and begin a relationship that mystifies both their circle of friends, as George\&#39;s friends think he has joined up with a bunch of puffs, while Bacon\&#39;s clique of vipers are titillated to no end by this unholy union, as they make sniping remarks directed at how dull George is, trying to get the devilish Bacon to say what he sees in him, even though George will heretofore become the model for Bacon\&#39;s decadent and lifeless figures, as well as his almost full time lover, except when Bacon picks up an odd stud or two and locks the hapless George out of the studio flat. He will also generously support George with money and proper clothing and booze.\nThat George and he are almost complete opposites, able to use each other for whatever it is worth, is part of the fascination of the bleak material covered, as the film becomes an exercise in excesses and debauchery, that is covered so wantoningly, with Bacon referring to his relationship with George at one point, as the man who does odd jobs for him once in a while.\nBut somewhere in the seven year relationship between George and Bacon, Bacon tires of him and chooses to let the demise of George become complete without showing one bit of concern for him. This should not be too surprising, because he proudly tells us that he is optimistic about nothing and finds beauty in the suffering and bloodshed of others, such as at a car accident, relating how it excites him to see the bodies lie randomly on the road, and at a professional fight we see how he nearly has an orgasm in public when he gets splattered with the boxer\&#39;s blood.\nThat his precarious lifestyle often shines as brightly as his visual images, as his oeuvre of work is presented to us through these visions, rather than seeing it as on framed paintings, and this is stupendously done by a brilliant stroke of filmmaking, as the artist\&#39;s soul was seen crawling out of the recesses of his warped but talented mind, as distorted lenses and mirrored images and shaded colorings and quick editing of the images, were all effectively used to enhance the eeriness of the artist\&#39;s visions.\nThe nonlinear story is transcribed for the most part either in Bacon\&#39;s studio or in the bar where his circle of friends hold court, as Bacon who is the submissive one in sex, is the ever aggressive and dominant one with both his sham friends, as he notes realistically what they are to him, and his George, who foolishly tells him that he loves him and is quickly admonished with the following put down from the master, &#34;from what bad TV show did you get that from?&#34;\nI must confess, I never cared for Bacon\&#39;s art, though I was somewhat impressed with the raw power of his blood curling images and the deathlike objectivity he gives his work. But I was put off with his inability to reach farther back into the human soul and see what the whole being is like as the truly great artists such as a Blake or Durer can, who know both good and evil. To know one of the contraries is not enough, as it probably means that you can\&#39;t even see that as clearly as you should, as in Bacon\&#39;s case, what evil is for him to see, is mostly felt as a raging flux inside, something Jacobi captured on screen, that made this film a very special one, and saved it from the doldrums it could have been. It is rare that an actor can really sense the mood and spirit of an artist, because when he doesn\&#39;t, it is to the detriment of the film, no matter how good the story is or who the artist is that is being portrayed. What comes to my mind is the risible performances of Charlton Heston as Micheangelo and Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh, or more recently Leonard Di Caprio trying to be convincing as an unknown artist in TITANIC. Their lack of credibility as artists, were enough to make the films they were in seem phony. Off hand, I can only think of Derek Jarman\&#39;s CARAVAGGIO, to match this one in intensity and homosexuality, and integrity of performance.\nBut whatever I think of Bacon and his art work or the unwatchable moments this film had, and the pangs I got from his negative philosophy, and how the story was going down a cul-de-sac, I was nevertheless, still dazzled by a performance from Derek Jacobi, that left me breathless, and by a first time director, who is in every mannerism an artist and feels like an artist does, and was able to translate that inspiration onto the screen, which is no easy feat to do.\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;La Religieuse (director: Jacques Rivette; cast: Anna Karina (Suzanne Simonin), Liselotte Pulver (Mme de Chelles), Micheline Presle Mme de Moni), Francisco Rabal (Dom Morel ), Christine Lenier (Madame Simonin), 1966-Fr.)\nDiderot wrote this novel in 1796, based on a true story about the corruption and evil in the monastic orders, where it was the practice of families, even against the will of their children, to give money to the order so that their child could stay forever in the monastery. There was no way out for the child if later on the child was not found suited for this life and wanted to leave. This dreadful condition of life, is fully captured by Rivette, as he tells this story of woe in a detached and austere way, using the monastery as a metaphor for the corruption and decay of the world- at- large.This film was banned in France during the 60s for being anti-Catholic.\nThis is Rivette\&#39;s most linear and comprehensible film, clearly following the unwilling nun to be (Karina), as she learns of her fate, as her spiteful aristocratic mother sends her to a nunnery against her will because the mother conceived her illegitimately, and in order to avoid disgracing the family she removes the 16-year-old child to a monastery, and the child is powerless to do anything about it. The harshness and dreariness of the story is so pervasive, filled with so much pathos and heart wrenching evil, that it takes a great director such as Rivette, to bring life and breath to the soul of the film, to keep out any superfluous material to this already startling story. In his no nonsense hands, we witness the superstitious beliefs present at the time and how God was made into the lies these so-called religious people lived their lives for, practicing a hypocrisy that lingers on, even in modern society.\nAs Karina becomes part of the monastic order, we follow the routines the sisters do, and view with horror the sterility of their life, and do not question any person who is still sane enough to be wanting to get out of there, even if we are shown later on, that life for the poor and the powerless in the real world was also an unfortunate one.\nAt her first convent, after her first abbess who tried to offer her some maternal kindness, understanding her situation, dies, Karina runs into inhumane treatment when the new mother superior finds that she is not willing to be part of their vocation. The lack of compassion and twisted religious concepts, become too evident to her, she realizes that she will never be able to adjust to this abnornal life. And since she went into the monastery as a teen-ager, she actually has very little knowledge of the outside world, but still feels confident that the outside world is a better choice for her, but will soon find out that the outside world can offer her no reassurances for a sane life.\nA lawyer, retained by those outside of the church who are interested in removing some of the churchly political powers, argues against her staying in this cruel monastery and tries to get her released from her obligation totally, but the best the church authorities can do, is transfer her to a more humane monastery.\nIn her new monastery, she will next face a lesbian mother superior who desires to have sex with her, and a priest who is her confessor but has grown dispirited with the church, as he gets her to escape from the monastery and then tries to molest her. Her gloom now becomes so great, that she cannot find solace in anything, even as she truly searches to find the God within her, and becomes the only one from the monastery who is really religious. Her plight becomes so horrid, as she cannot adjust to the outside world that she has escaped to, that she still finds herself being sought for as a sex object, and in her pitiful state, she chooses suicide as the only way out of her misery.\nRivette has made a memorable film, a grand and mesmorizing film, one that towers over other such benign Hollywood films relating to this subject matter. Her tragic plight is a powerful story, told with perfection of style and purpose, a story that is hard to put out of your mind.\nREVIEWED ON 1/27/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;BOB LE FLAMBEUR (BOB THE GAMBLER) (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Roger Duchesne (Bob, The Gambler), Isabelle Corey (Anne), Guy Decomble (The Inspector) , Daniel Cauchy (Paolo), Claude Cerval (Jean), Simone Paris (Yvonne), Howard Vernon (McKimmie), 1955-Fr.)\nA wonderful noir-type of film, that is actually more about style and ambiance than it is about what usually underlines the dark themes of the ticklish noir film subjects, that delve into the underbelly of their protagonist and evoke a certain sense of injustice in the world. All that is superfluous to BOB THE GAMBLER; in this film, he is more interested in taking care of his trenchcoat and fedora and giving hand-outs to those he likes, than he is in doing anything else but looking good. This is a story about a compulsive gambler (Roger) who lives well in Paris without working, living by his own code of ethics and ability to live off his gambling. Impulsively, one day, when he runs into a bad losing streak, he decides to get a crew together to rob the Deauville Casino, a place where he believes there is 800 million francs in the vault, but is an almost impossible job to do. With a recklessly cool non-chalance, our hero gathers his crew together despite all the obstacles in front of him: including betrayal in his ranks and the fact that his police friend knows that he is going to commit the crime.\nThe film is so beautifully filmed, reflecting the lighthearted charm and wit of the main character and the sleaziness of the part of the city he loves, as the camera kindly follows him as he makes his rounds at night until he is finished playing craps and cards, driving down the sordid streets of Montmartre, entering the low-life parts of the Pigalle section, watching out in a protective way for a young, attractive 16-year-old (Corey), who he sees eating french fries and then getting picked-up by a sailor on a motorbike. She, as the femme fatale in this film, will prove to be too willing to sleep with anyone to forge ahead, but this does not deter Bob from liking her and treating her with respect, as Bob slowly drives by in his sleek Caddy convertible, taking notice of the street as if he were the one responsible for its vivacity and sanity; thusly, finding her again in his favorite bar, this time talking to a pimp he can\&#39;t stand. So Bob gives her a decent meal and some cash, and the key to his room, but does not take advantage of her, instead, makes it easy for his young protege (Daniel) to move in on her.\nThis is so much a movie about how the young and old can be screw-ups but are still okay with themselves, seemingly daring life to keep them from what they want to be. The now middle-aged Bob in his younger days got caught robbing a bank and spent time in jail for it. He claims to be living a crime free life for the past twenty years, enjoying his flashy lifestyle, acting as freely as he can, not looking back at things that went wrong. By the film\&#39;s end we are convinced that we know a lot about Bob, and come to the conclusion that he\&#39;s a pretty good guy, thinking to ourselves, even though he is linked to gambling and crime, nevertheless, he does possess a wonderful character about him, something that is worthy of our praise.\nA great film, that is shot with perfection, capturing the nuances and finesse a master film-maker brings to his work, while shooting a low-budget b/w film, that tells a simple story, but is done with such effervescence, as to make us feel so much the better that we at least met this perfectly flawed character, even if it is only on film, since, for most of us, it is more than likely we will not have the chance to meet the likes of a true character like him in person.\nREVIEWED ON 12/24/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LADIES ON THE ROCKS (director: Christian Braad Thomsen; cast: Anne Marie Helger (Laura), Helle Ryslinge (Micha), Flemming Quist Møller (Leonard), Hans Henrik Clemensen (Hans-Henrik), 1983-Denmark)\nThe two girls, probably in their mid-twenties, Micha (Ryslinge) and Laura (Helger), have a variety revue act, which they named &#34;Ladies Trip&#34;, where they do comic skits with strong sexual innuendoes and some song numbers in various nightclubs, bars, and meeting halls across Denmark.\nMicha is single and disillusioned with her wry circumstances, feeling that life has dealt her some bad cards to play with, as her life is a game of losing hands. She is looking for something more romantic in her life and can\&#39;t find it in the men she goes out with. Leonard (Møller) is her rock and roll musician boyfriend who likes her because she is a good bang but finds he has nothing else in common with her, treating her with disrespect and coldness, overtly showing her that he doesn\&#39;t give one rap about her, and making no bones about it. She feels like an addict who is addicted sexually to this guy that she knows is no good for her and can\&#39;t do anything to get him out of her system, while hating herself for being as weak-minded about it as she is. Laura, on the other hand, is in an upper-class marriage, living a very comfortable existence with her stable business executive husband and two sweet daughters. Her husband treats her act as a hobby, and seems to offer her all the creature comforts of what an ideal nuclear family should have. Appearance-wise, she seems to have it all in her favor.\nWe soon see Micha and Laura preparing to go on a long tour with their act, with Micha almost out-of-her head with rage that Leonard stood her up for another girl, swearing she never wants to see him again, while Laura breathes a sigh of relief that she has escaped for a bit from the stuffy existence she has, though she is none too happy about Micha being on such a downer to start their tour, telling her to put that bad stuff out of her mind, that this is our trip.\nThis is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story, as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that can\&#39;t become real, without any particular message to deliver, except that these two have their hands full coping with their life, as it seems, it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive.\nOn their first stop, they give a bawdy performance in the library and are then asked to stay after and answer questions from the audience. Since they consider themselves artists, they feel their act speaks for itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile viewer of their show, an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to women who have that problem, as she upsets them as she rails at them before walking out.\nThe remainder of the film takes place on the road, emphasizing how the girls relate to each other: from their girl talk and gossipy chatter and need to let off steam from all the anger that builds up in them, to their ever-demanding personal lives, as Micha is still hard-pressed to find a true romantic relationship and Laura is confused about who she is.\nMicha angrily questions the bourgeois patrons who invite them for an after-the-show snack, how they can justify making most of the money off their work and look down upon them with a snobbish attitude, while they just scrape by on a minimal amount of money even though they do all the hard work. Laura has retreated to the basement with their patron\&#39;s elderly father who has a tremendous passion for trains and runs his model trains to imitate the Danish train system, even to the point of its lateness of schedule. Since the family treats him as someone not to be taken seriously, yet it is quite evident, that he, alone, has a real love for something that the bourgeois in his family just don\&#39;t have.\nWe see how tough the road is for the girls, as they make toast on their hotel\&#39;s radiator, and how they bring a piss pail along with them because some of the places they play at don\&#39;t have bathrooms, and we see how uncomfortable they feel, always on the move and always cast as outsiders who feel alienated from the locals.\nWhat comes across very lucidly, is how others look upon them so much reflects the attitudes they come away with, as their comic act begins to get more bitter and more sexually revealing, as their lives begin spinning out of control, though their act is working and they are playing to mostly sold-out houses.\nWhen Hans-Henrik (Clemensen), the very middle-class husband of Laura catches one of their out-of -town shows and takes Laura out to eat in a fancy restaurant she is most uncomfortable in, their relationship is at last shown to be the sham it is, as he questions the explicit sexual kinkiness of her act and the lowbrow humor it arouses, ashamed if any one in his office would see a wife of his in such a third-rate show.\nOn the road, the filmmaker brings out the opinions the various sort of people the girls meet have of performers and, especially, female ones out on their own. A chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor trying to sell their product, but the important thing is, if you try hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might not even notice it. That his gimmick is to get the children to eat the chocolate first, then the parents are delighted that the kids like the chocolate, so his sale becomes an easy one. He fails miserbly when he tries to seduce Micha, which should tell you what the filmmaker thinks of his approach to life. A bartender tells them the last time he was at a show was 20 years ago, and he walked out at intermission. The girls innocently tell him that they don\&#39;t have intermissions during their shows.\nIt is hard to say for sure what the film is crying out to say from all the self-discoveries that keep happening to the girls, as their act grows despite- and- because of their personal failures, and as Laura gets divorced and the kids become showbiz kids travelling with the act, and Micha is stuck with the problem she always has, she can\&#39;t find Mr. Right.\nIt seems as if the women are disgruntled that men have let them down, and that their life has turned into a series of one-night stands. Though, what stands out, is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way, that there public appearance might seem calm and collected, but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life.\nThis thought provoking film, touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity, but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness, that it couldn\&#39;t focus in on any one theme completely, as it mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically, pointing out that maybe, that is all one can hope for, yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up, that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation.\nUltimately, the road itself must be considered the goal of the trip, and this engaging film allows you to feel the pains of the girls who are still searching for their own identities; but strangely enough, even as the film ends with the weary girls wondering what\&#39;s next, as they finish their act and are sitting where the audience sat moments before, you get the feeling that things will somehow or other work out for them, that these are some pretty toughened and likable characters, and they have left a good impression with the audience, which is why their act had so many sell-outs and why they should be pleasing to the audience that sees them on film, except this audience has to look at the girl\&#39;s a bit deeper knowing all the disappointments and discomforts they have gone through, and I don\&#39;t know if there is a mass audience out there willing to see things that are harder to look at, without feeling remiss about what they are seeing.\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;SILENT TOUCH, THE (director: Krzysztof Zanussi; cast: Aleksander Bardini (Professor Jerzy Kern), Lothaire Bluteau (Stefan), Sofie Gråbøl (Annette Berg), Max von Sydow (Henrik Kesdi), Sarah Miles ( Henrik\&#39;sWife), Peter Hesse Overgaard (Joseph), 1992-Poland)\nIt is hard to imagine how a film about a musical genius, Henrik Kesdi, that has a renown veteran actor (von Sydow) in it, who is quite adept at playing the part called for, of such a curmudgeon and unsociable giant in the annals of musical composition, and the film being so meritoriously scored musically as to give it the proper classical musical atmosphere for the story to take off on, plus it is directed by an innovative and critically acclaimed Polish director, known for his intellectual films that are implicit studies in character (CAMOUFLAGE, CONTRACT, ILLUMINATION), should fall so short in its ability to be a creative film, and is only carried to the level of marginal respectability by the weight of the above named actor and this after a brilliant opening scene that portends to a film that will be interminably beguiling, that is based on an idea for a film that is both original and captivating, just baffles me, as I try to ponder what went wrong and how moribund and cliche-ridden the story came to be.\nThe film opens with the Polish musicologist student, Stefan (Lothaire Bluteau), tossing in his sleep from a recurring dream in which he hears a few bars of magical music. He goes in the middle of the night with this news to see his music professor Kern (Bardini), who says this sound might be linked with someone he went to school with, the composer Henrik Kesdi, who had a very promising future, but during WW11, his wife was a holocaust victim and as a protest to the cruelty of the world, he has chosen to remain silent ever since. Since Kesdi is living in Denmark, Stefan goes there to see the reclusive composer.\nHenrik is seen in his splendid country house as a bitter, crotchety, infirmed 74-year-old, who has remarried a much younger woman, Helena (Miles), who is willing to put up with his manipulative behavior, as he claims that all he wants is to be left alone--- to enjoy my incontinence in private.\nStefan forces his way into the house of the composer, even though he is not welcomed at first, by being able to cure the composer of his backaches by using a divining rod and discovering a stream under his bedroom and telling the composer to switch rooms when he sleeps. Well, this cure might work on film, and who knows, this information might have some medical merit that I am not aware of, but as part of the plot, Stefan as the healer, ingratiating himself with the composer to break his musical silence and give it all for the world of music, started to give me a headache, as it reminded me of all the formula films of this nature that I have sat through in the past, thinking that this easily could have been the theme of a sports film or a multitude of other films, and that the splendid idea that opened the picture was about to be destroyed by contrivance and implausibility. O great muses, where are you when the filmmaker needed you most !\n&gt;From here on in, it is all downhill, as you can already guess the glorious ending to the film, of Henrik creating that great score, so what is left, is filling in the details leading up to this grand accomplishment, and for that we can use an attractive young Danish girl, and that will come in the form of a musical secretary, Annette (Gråbøl), who will tease the young musicologist but be passionately attracted to the cunningly considerate and intellectually gifted older maestro, who she will become pregnant with, as Helena will be very undertanding of her husband\&#39;s needs and they will form a pretty odd menage-a-trois, as Stefan will depart for Poland, having brought goodness into the world in the form of musical genius, but feeling empty inside because his love for Annette is unrequited.\nThe moral of the story centers around whether you believe one\&#39;s self-sacrifice for the good of the world is a genuine and necessary one, or that unfilled desires are the height of all deceits. These and other interesting questions could have been delved into, if the plot wasn\&#39;t so ludicrous, and if the film wasn\&#39;t so uninspired, as to make it almost unbearable to stomach.

 &#39;A PIECE OF PLEASURE (director: Claude Chabrol; cast: Danielle Gegauff (Esther), Clemence Gégauff (Elsie), Paul Gégauff (Philippe), Paula Moore (Sylvia Murdoch), Michel Valette (Katkof), Cécile Vassort (Annie), Pierre Santini, Giancarlo Sisti, 1974-France)\nA very bitter love story unfolds, reflecting on the break-up of a seemingly happy marriage, by circumstances that seemed odd and inexplicable, unless it is true, that certain people can\&#39;t handle their happiness and have to do something to screw that up. The stars of the film, who play a married couple, are probably playing out on screen a lot of what their married life was like before their real-life divorce. Paul Gégauff (Philippe), his ex-wife Danielle Gegauff (Esther), and their daughter Clemence Gégauff (Elsie) are the stars of the film.\nAn odd thing occurred after the movie was made, Paul Gégauff, Chabrol\&#39;s favorite screenwriter, was stabbed to death in 1983 by his second wife.\nThis film has both the look of a daytime TV soaper and a cheapie movie. It never develops into anything more than it starts out to be, no matter how the story turns, it can only be a twisted psychological tale depicting a couple living on the outskirts of Paris, with him being the very erudite and upper-class teacher of life to his attractive but unsophisticated peasant born wife. One day he tells his wife that he had six affairs that didn\&#39;t mean anything to him during their ten years of marriage, and when she is forced to tell him that she never had an affair he insists that she have an affair with an Arab guitar player named Habib, someone he doesn\&#39;t even like. I can\&#39;t begin to explain why he does that, unless he is so arrogant and bored with life that he feels he has to do it. That he loses his wife after she has a number of sexual encounters with her new lover, should not be particularly surprising.\nHow Chabrol handles this volatile material is what brings even more vagueness to the story then he usually brings to his stories, as he concentrates on Philippe\&#39;s changing psychological states that vary from being a doting father to his cute daughter to being a vile bully to his wife. As things change for the worse in their marriage, the couple give up their rented house in the country and move back to the city, as Paris offers them a chance to change and grow intellectually and emotionally. She takes a job as a publicist with Habib\&#39;s musical company. It is not really clear how Philippe earns his money, but he is involved in some kind of business dealings with his friends. The tables are now turned on him, as he angrily and jealously pursues his wife, who continues to see Habib, as he disparages her taste, disapproving that she hangs around with his superficial philosopher friends, who don\&#39;t even read what they are bullshitting about, and he becomes terribly disappointed that she falls for that group. Their break-up is now for real. So what does the love-sick Philippe do, but meet a Scottish lady, Paula Moore (Sylvia Murdoch), who has been divorced three times, and one of her former husbands is Habib. Philippe quickly marries her, but soon is pained by the sweet memories of Esther, and once again seeks Esther out.\nI found enough interest in this film to say that it is not completely without merit, but I did not think it told a crisp enough story to make it anything but one of Chabrol\&#39;s experimental so-so films. The demise of Philippe, the failure of him to let his wife be who she is without letting go of his tyrannical hold on her, made him an unsympathetic character from the beginning to the end of the story. For the film to say, that men always ask questions and women don\&#39;t, is not exactly a modern attitude to have these days, and it was unclear to me what Chabrol\&#39;s thinking about this really was, whether it was an ironical attitude or a stab at saying something that was so ridiculous that no one could take it seriously. Chabrol has made a career out of being vague in his films, and more often than not it has worked to his benefit, but not this time.\nREVIEWED ON 3/21/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;MEDEA (TV) (director: Lars von Trier; cast: Vera Gebuhr, Ludmilla Glinska (Glauce), Solbjørg Højfeldt, Henning Jensen (Creon), Udo Kier (Jason), Kirsten Olesen (Medea), Baard Owe (Aiceus), 1987-Denmark)\nSo what if the great Danish director, Carl Theodor Dreyer\&#39;s screenplay, written with Preben Thomsen in the mid-60s, is not adhered to, so be it! Dreyer died in 1968, unable to get funding for the film.What counts is what von Trier has done with the film he has inherited from Dreyer. Right ! So who cares about his self-promotional schemes that have turned many people off him. I\&#39;m talking about him saying that he communed with the spirits of Dreyer and those spirits approved of what he is doing to change the film. I just can\&#39;t get caught up in that nonsense, for me, it\&#39;s what I see on screen that counts. It does not matter how others filmed it or would have filmed it, whether it is Pasolini\&#39;s most interesting 1969 version of it, starring Maria Callas or von Trier\&#39;s take on it, that is the better one. And even though both Pasolini and von Trier are gifted filmmakers, with Pasolini, in my opinion, being the more poetical and imaginative of the two, nevertheless, Dreyer is still the master, and I would have expected more from him than I do from the others, though I am pleased to say, I am sated by both these differing versions of Medea, but in differing ways.\nVision and intensity are certainly important elements in a film, and that is what is the driving force behind this film, based on Euripides\&#39; tragedy, that was made for Danish TV. And that is what made me become taken aback by the power of von Trier\&#39;s camera, the majesty of his amber and golden and brownish shadings, that is what made the tragedy even more moving, as he took me into the hearts of the innocent kids this woman hung from a small tree in order to satisfy her vanity. It was as mythic as the crucification of Jesus or the sacrifice Abraham would have done if God asked him to do it. This tale of Medea is still a living myth, one that every generation should come to its own terms with, and that is precisely what Trier has attempted to do.\nKnowing the story doesn\&#39;t necessarily preclude that we can feel the story. Whatever opinion you might have about von Trier\&#39;s telling of the myth, you can agree that his version of it, is definetly a deeply felt emotional experience, one that went to the heart of the matter in terms of feeling the agony of what a woman who has lost touch with herself because of her pride, is going through. By emphasizing her feelings as being only for herself, her irrationality is made rational, even if it isn\&#39;t rational. Through her fall from grace, we see the tragedy unfold, and the deadly consequences of her jealousy and sense of being wronged come around to its bitter fruition.\nMedea (Kirsten) has been dumped by her husband, Jason (Udo), for a younger and more attractive woman, Glauce (Ludmilla), whose father is King Creon (Henning). Jason comes across as a modern male chauvinist pig, someone with cold feelings, whose ambitious nature rules his life. Medea is the scorned woman, the intuitive one, the one capable of performing black magic. When told by King Creon that she must leave the country with her two sons or else, she plots her revenge. And she gets her wish for revenge, by sweet talking Jason into accepting her wedding gift for his bride, a queen\&#39;s crown that she has dabbed with poison, hoping that the bride will prick herself on it. Playing on Jason\&#39;s paternal instincts, she gets him to believe that she wants him to keep the kids because she was wrong and he was right in what he did, now that she has had time to think it over. Thusly, she talks him into softening up his bride with the gift, and then, he will be able to get her to ask her father to give permission for the kids to remain with him and his new bride, and she would be content to leave the country knowing that her children will be properly cared for.\nThe dialogue is sparse. The open air scenery is intense, it appeared to me as if I was looking at Van Gogh\&#39;s wheatfields, with the wind swirling forcefully in and out of the fields. There was a mystical feel to his mise- en- scene, tragedy was inevitably in the air, whether in the distant sea or on the faces of the children running through the fields, playing like children do but stopping at times to look into the camera with perplexed expressions on their faces, as the wind runs across their blond hair.\nAnd this tale is all the more a tragedy... because Medea takes the children to the tree to hang them even though she loves them both. And when the younger one runs away, the older one brings him back to her, and her deed is done, her mold is cast in stone, as she then proceeds to carry out the death of the older, the more obedient son, the one she dearly loves as much as she loves anything else in this world.\nAll that is left for us to see, is the final fade-out shot, with the disbelieving and enfeebled Jason, who is left with a poisoned father-in-law and bride, and the dead children he would have abandoned or kept with him, whatever the circumstances dictated. As a result, he has lost his will to live, and we see him moaning in pain as he takes his life in the amber fields.\nKristen is an accomplished and noted actress, her performance was as emotionally and intellectually satisfying as the one Dreyer got from his young unknown actress (Renée Falconetti) in his THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1928). The only difference is that from Dreyer\&#39;s style of simplicity in filmmaking, we can feel the pains ourself, we didn\&#39;t need it enlarged and magnified by wasted and unnecessary movements. For von Trier, he must get himself catapulted into the story, simplicity and spareness is not enough for him, he doesn\&#39;t trust it, everyone must know that this is his stylized version of the myth.\nThat he succeeds in this film, is certainly evident. He succeeds because he has found the right Medea for the part, and has caught enough of the mood without ruining it as he almost does, by going overboard with his excesses. I am mainly referring to the hanging scenes of the children. He came very close to turning me off, as I was beginning to suspect that these scenes didn\&#39;t have to be that explicit in all its morbid details, the idea of having the older child go back for the younger one, seemed to me, to be exploitive and incredulous, as well as unnecessary. All we had to see was the pained expression on Medea and the children and we could have drawn our own visions, even more powerful ones than the ones we materially witnessed.\nThe reason Dreyer is a master and one of the greatest directors ever, is because he did not compromise his integrity or the film\&#39;s integrity going after anything that was superfluous to the telling of the story. I always get the feeling when I am seeing a Dreyer film, I am seeing something that is truly visionary. Yet when I see a von Trier film, I can\&#39;t say the same, even though he is a very talented director, I just can\&#39;t trust his judgment when it comes to telling the story without it seeming to be pretentious. I am never sure if he really got it or if he is putting me on.\nREVIEWED ON 3/6/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39;s World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LIFE OF JESUS (director: Bruno Dumont; cast: Freddy (David Douche), Marie (Marjorie Cottreel), Kader (Kader Chaatouf), Yvette (Geneviève Cottreel), Michou (Samuel Boidin), 1997)\nIn a northern French village (Bailleul), in the region of Flanders, the roar of a motorbike is heard coming down the deserted town\&#39;s empty streets. This is the first film by Bruno Dumont, as it takes us to a town that is so cheerless we will never want to put it on our tourist agenda when visiting the beautiful Flemish countryside. Dumont, a former teacher, uses mostly nonprofessional actors and the problem he has with that, is that the story is so unnerving and there is no one around who could add pizzazz to it, to give us a reason for enjoying it, as we meet the 20-year-old inarticulate, skinhead looking Fred (Douche), who obediantly kisses his mom, the proprietor of a small cafe as he gets off his bike and enters her cafe, and we watch him go to his room and have sex with his pretty blond girlfriend Marie (Marjorie), who works as a cashier in a grocery store and lives for these sexual encounters, but shows no real enjoyment over them, and even complains to him that he hurt her once.\nAppearances don\&#39;t lie, the town is boring, and Fred is an unhappy man, with fiery glazed eyes and a sullen stare to go along with the epileptic seizures he often gets, which seem to come upon him when things are not going right for him.\nThe first problem I have with this film, is why this title, since there is not one single thing about this film that pertains to the myth of Jesus. I understand the title comes curiously enough from a philologist, Ernest Renan, whose idea of Christianity was the basis of the script. But this inarticulate film failed to convey any religious feeling, and therefore it made no sense to keep that misleading title. The &#34;life of Fred&#34; would have been a more appropriate and less insulting title.\nDumont shot this film almost like a straight documentary, using lots of close-ups on the youngsters, with long stretches of nothing much happening on the screen, cinema verite style, except the annoying sound of motorbikes racing through town, as it traces the life and lives of a troubled bunch of youngsters, with nothing to do but ride their bikes, play chicken with passing cars, hurl racist slurs, and pay no heed to what is happening in the world, as they cannot fit into society, and are angry at their state of being. Though it should be pointed these are not criminal kids, just the regular garden variety of locals.\nIt is a film where nothing happens, but boredom is rampant, where a sentence of dialogue makes us pick up our ears, as if something is being said that must be heard and we don\&#39;t want to miss it. But we soon learn that nothing that is said is meaningful. These youngsters are not likable or approachable, even watching them on film is chilling, as they are so unmoving, that it is easy for the mind to wander and think what a waste of time this is, what\&#39;s the point, one can get gloomy just by watching these misfits hang around doing nothing.\nWhat saddens this group, is the death by AIDS of one of their member\&#39;s brother, which shakes them up, seeing someone in this small-town die. Fred arranges a day at the beach to console the grieving brother.\nThis group of 20-year-olds, on welfare and on a dead-end mission in life, has tuned out of expecting anything good to happen to them. The only one getting a bit of a bang out of life is Freddy, who says he loves Marie, and can\&#39;t get enough of her.\nInto the picture enters a handsome Arab, Kader (Kader), who is insulted by the group\&#39;s racial slurs directed at him and his family, as he responds with his own brand of stupidity and macho behavior, by aggressively showing a sexual interest in Marie. This gives the group an outlet for their restlessness and violent tendencies. It also underscores the racial tensions in society, where bigotry is an accepted fact of life.\nBut the group first must embarrass their families by a gang molestation of an obese drum majorette in their marching band, who is cruelly hurt by this attack, telling her farmer father about it, who makes arrangements with the boys\&#39; families to pay him for the damage or he will go the police.\nFred messes up the one seemingly good thing in his life, and loses his girlfriend over that incident. As a result, the racial slurs grow into violence, as Marie takes an interest in the Arab, and the hatred and the disappointments in Fred\&#39;s life get out of control and the bitterness that has slowly built-up sinks firmly into his skin, as it culminates in the attack on the Arab, who in all fairness, acted very stupidly himself, bringing on an unneeded escalation of the conflict by his own display of testiness.\nIn the end, there is just a feeling of impotence here, that there is a major problem out there in society and there does not seem to be one single answer to solve it. In some respects, these kids reminded me of the Littleton, Colorado kids, who spouted neo-Nazi slogans and massacred a number of high school students, as their rage built and no one could really see what was happening.\nThis is the kind of film you might see once and you get all that you possibly can from it, as it is hauntingly told, but there is no point in seeing it again. It is such an ugly story, and since it would have been more suited to be a documentary than a feature movie, as it offered no drama or enjoyment in the viewing of it. It was more fit to be a primer for the ills of society put under the microscope, and how aimless a young man can be, and uncommunicative, that he so easily loses the one person who could have held him in check.\nIf this film was trying to be told from a Christian perspective, that what these kids needed was religion and moral values, then it certainly did not make its case. There are just no answers here for what happened that can make sense.\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;WELCOME TO THE DOLL HOUSE (director: Todd Solondz; cast: Heather Matarazzo, Victoria Davis, Christina Brucato, Christina Vidal, Siri Howard, Brendan Sexton Jr., Telly Pontidis, 1996)\nA film about an unpopular girl (Heather) who can\&#39;t fit in with her seventh-grade classmates, who wants so much to be like them and to have them love her, that she is willing to do just about anything to fit in, even be raped by the school bully, if need be. She goes by the name of &#34;Dogface Weiner&#34; to her cruel schoolmates, who also taunt her that she is a &#34;lesbo,&#34; which she stammers out, is not so. Solondz pulls no punches, pointing out the utter futility of adolescence for someone like her, who can\&#39;t help being a nerd and who receives no emotional support from home. She, in fact, looks a lot like the director. So we can guess that some of these horrible experiences are something that might have happened to him in puberty. This loner theme is belabored and beaten into the story, so much so, that the obvious couldn\&#39;t be made more obvious. There are no subtle messages. There is, also, no revenge of the nerd, or any analytical probes into what she can do about her low self-esteem (and I am most grateful for that). This is simply a film that looks at why schools and families, for the most part, impart no concern about &#34;culture&#34; in the children they teach and raise, and why they can\&#39;t respond with civility and intelligence to those students who need the most help that they can get. Heather is so beaten down, that she just wants to gain some self-esteem from her school experience, any kind of encouragement would have been enormously helpful.\nWhat sums up her situation and is her main concern, can be found in this conversation with her classmate, when she asks, &#34;Why do you hate me?&#34; and the response is given so bluntly: &#34;Because you are so ugly.&#34; Her home life is also filled with angst and bitterness. The parents are a cardboard caricaricture of a successful New Jersey suburbanite household, who dote on Heather\&#39;s cute younger sister, leaving Heather out in the cold, and they respect but do not love their high school son, who is a nerd but is able to function very well in school, and has even gone as far as repressing his sexual drive so that he can be concerned only with getting good marks in school and thereby getting into a top college. He acts more like he was an adult than a teenager, even the rock band he starts, is not a rebellious one, but he does it because it will look good on his resume for college. For Heather, the parents simply have no understanding or love, she is reduced to either trying to be a child again by retreating to a clubhouse in her backyard, or trying to foolishly hangout with an older high schooler, the phoney stud, who sometimes plays in her brother\&#39;s band. In any case, whatever she does seems pathetic, and even though she is very smart, she does not do well in school.\nSince the film sinks or swims, depending on how credible Heather is in depicting this unhappy youngster with her vulnerabilities, it is safe to say that she fitted the role perfectly. The film was intense and pulsating when it zoomed in on Heather\&#39;s travails, but lost something when it brought unnecessary action into play, such as a child kidnapping and the problem of drugs being sold in school. There was no place to go in developing Heather\&#39;s character by adding these major societal problems to Heather\&#39;s story, that\&#39;s for another film.\nYou would think, that with Heather being a victim of persecution, that would ensure her to be kind to others who are picked on. But that is not the case, she shows a mean streak by striking back at them when it suits her fancy, for example, hurting the young kid she stays with in the clubhouse, who is as lost as she is, unnecessarily calling him &#34;a faggot.&#34;\nSolondz knows his subject well, he is able to understand and convey what it is to be brought up with self-hatred and how such people can react by being sometimes just as cruel as the society they are a product of, and the result is an unusual movie that focuses in on a subject very few filmmakers have chosen to do.\nIt was unfortunate that Heather never evolved, so the cruelty we observed in the beginning of the film was also the way she was observed when the film ended; nevertheless, an honest effort was put forth by the filmmaker to see how school age children cope with their unique problems they have.\nREVIEWED ON 10/2/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;GODS AND MONSTERS (director:Bill Condon; cast: (James Whale) Ian McKellen, (Clayton Boone) Brendan Fraser, (Whale\&#39;s housekeeper, Hanna) Lynn Redgrave, (Boone\&#39;s girlfriend, Betty) Lolita Davidovich, (David Lewis) David Dukes, (Mr. Kay) Jack Plotinick, (Elsa Lanchester) Rosalind Ayres, (Boris Karloff) Jack Betts, 1998)\nJames Whale (Ian) is the son of working class parents in north England, who escaped his early poverty to become a successful director, noted for his famous monster films. James Whale directed the original FRANKENSTEIN (31), THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (35), THE OLD DARK HOUSE (32), and THE INVISIBLE MAN (33)--- which was his personal favorite. Whale, always the aesthete and snob, comments to an interviewer that he just directed the first two Frankensteins, the others were done by hacks. He also did some non-horror films, most notable is the classy musical SHOWBOAT (36), and his most inauspicious one is, THE ROAD BACK (37).\nHe died of mysterious circumstances in his Hollywood pool in 1957, this film clears up that mystery (at least, hypothetically) and probes into his homosexual life, as Jimmy, as he liked to be called, is seen in his last few weeks alive, living infirmed with the ill effects of a stroke that makes him either forgetful when medicated or when unmedicated seeing a lot of images at once, as if it were thunderstorms in the sky, in the form of violent hallucinations from the past.\nWhat highlights this film and makes it propelled on a high octane level, is the bravura physical performance of Ian McKellen, whose presence on screen is gigantic as a swish personality, much like a few other great performances accomplished recently about gifted artistic and intellectual English queers, such as Derek Jacobi as Francis Bacon in LOVE IS THE DEVIL and John Hurt\&#39;s performance of a fictionalized stuffy professor in LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND.\nTo gain access to what this fictionalized but mostly real-life film is about, one has to look at Jimmy as a homosexual, whose every movement is influenced by the lust he craves for men and how cunning he is in trying to entice them, as we see him at his playful best in the splendor of his tasteful home, being taken care of by the heavily foreign accented housekeeper (Redgrave), who wears her cross over her apron in earnest, fearing Jimmy\&#39;s sins of the flesh will take him to hell, yet finding in herself the strength to disapprove of his behavior but still be his most trustworthy caretaker for the last 15 years. She is wonderfully dour in her supporting role.\nIf it is fear or disgust of homosexuals that repels you, this film will displease you, even though its overt physical sex is minimalized, yet every nuance of the film and all its projections are about what a queer is like. For openers, we have a pesty and patronizing film college student (Plotinick) who comes over to interview him, not interested in his homosexuality but in those horror films he made famous. Jimmy handles him with bemusement, life is but a strip poker game, he gleefully says, and since the student\&#39;s questions are leaving Jimmy feeling cold, he suggests that they make things interesting, at least for Whale, by having the student strip off a piece of clothes for any question asked and in response, Whale promises to answer any question honestly. This scene turns out to be a classically hilarious comedy routine, probably capturing Whale\&#39;s devilish personality as well or better than the more dramatic scenes did.\nThe serious focus of the film will become the strange relationship that will develop between the new gardener for the Whale house, Clayton Boone (Brendan), who looks like Adonis, and has caught the director\&#39;s roving eye, focusing in on his muscular arms and his tattoo from his marine days, of &#34;Death Over Dishonor,&#34; as he charms and beguiles him, knowing full-well that this stud is all heterosexual. Yet he feels very comfortable talking to the brutish Clayton and loves the chase of someone he is attracted to, who seems like a very nice and naive young man, but will come across later on as a young man with a lot of pent-up feelings and in need of a fatherly figure to talk to. Clayton is anything but literary, never even having heard of Whale before, just as Whale is hardly your prototypical fatherly figure. But Whale opens up with Clayton and becomes nostalgic about his life and his films, more so than with the film student who really knew his films, but was just perceived by Whale as a user of people. It seems that there was probably some deeply repressed psychological need in Whale to be accepted by certain types of people, which is why he devotes so much time to the uninspiring Clayton, it was as if he needed to have his approval to be gay.\nAnd Clayton gets to like the old man, despite what he can\&#39;t stand about him sexually, glad that he met someone who is famous or at least was at one time.\nWhat is most impressive and understated about the film, is the comic tone and lightness of Whale, much like the tone Whale used in his horror films, which he used to hide the real fear of death people have and their antagonism for monsters, whom Whale simply adored and would never make fun of. He comes across as debonair at all times, even when in the middle of a mild stroke, and terribly witty in the ways of Hollywood\&#39;s gays.\nThe only animated sexual delight that we see from him, comes by way of his ex-lover, the Hollywood producer, David Lewis (David), who after a particularly dry conversation welcoming Whale back home after his stroke, kisses Whale intimately on the lips as he departs the house.\nDuring his somewhat voluntarily retirement from Hollywood, not induced by any scandal, Whale reminds his interviewer, but from his antagonism with the studio for ruining his career by blaming him for the failure of THE ROAD BACK, which the studio interfered with unmercifully, ruining any chance of success that film may have had. He thusly retreated to his amateur passion for drawing, which he uses to lure Clayton into his studio, getting him to pose for a drawing of just his head.\nThere is Whale as the charmer, which is what this film personifies best, as we see him telling Hollywood stories and talking of his WW1 experiences, which are enhanced by the hallucinations he is having of those events, and as we see him nested at home with his florid flower garden and the olympic-sized pool in the background, which the director never uses for himself, but welcomes men to swim there in their natural comfort.\nReactions to Whale, as to whether you care for him or not, come about from how the participants in his life view his films, which we see them watch on TV. Clayton must somehow see something in them that affects him greatly, since he alone of the housekeeper and his ex-girlfriend, see\&#39;s something endearing in those films, yet he is turned off by Whale\&#39;s homosexuality, but he still poses for him, and that only seems to be because he wants something more than the money he is being paid to pose, he wants something from him that he is not quite sure that he can articulate. What both these men need is to get things off their chest, to talk to someone who can listen to them with some empathy, as they both suffer from an interminable loneliness and an emotional poverty of childhood: one with too many stories to tell, living a life of an upper class gentleman, pretending to be something he was not born into, but not caring about these pretenses anymore with Clayton, who is far removed from the circle of people he moves in, so he easily lets his hair down; and the other, with not enough stories he wants to tell, can only be a listener and be reluctantly drawn into talking about himself. Perhaps, both are drawn to each other because they don\&#39;t travel in the same circles and can relax with each other since no false representations of themselves are really needed.\nReal Hollywood figures are portrayed in the way Whale probably saw them, with his so-called monsters (Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester) there is a frank and polite distance, their friendliness seems genuine enough, as there is a keen recognition that their fame and illustriousness is linked together, while for the closet homosexual director, George Cukor, there is no love lost, as Whale expresses his displeasure at him at being a pushy upstart, while flashing back to the nude boy parties the hypercritical Cukor was secretly known for giving, and then we see how distant they seemed at meeting again in Cukor\&#39;s mansion, at a rather dull party to honor Princess Margaret (which never happened in real-life), where Whale takes Cukor\&#39;s cold reaction to him without any visible anger but shows a great deal of resentment at Cukor for getting to direct a lot of the better films that he wanted for himself.\nFor all its wonderful performances and charm and probative look into the gay Hollywood world, this is not a very important film, in the sense that it has little to say about the creative experience but a lot to say about how a queer man can manuever his way around the Hollywood of the past, as long as he didn\&#39;t make a big show out of his sexual predilections. Condon has very ably directed a likable and witty film on a very low budget, that makes its subject seem much greater than it is, it is as if Jimmy Whale invited us over for some iced tea and cucumber sandwiches and he told us a few things about himself and the filming of his Frankenstein movie before he got tired-and-all, so all we had left to ponder was the materialism and memories he was surrounded by, and how tired and painful life has become for him, as he wishes for a mercy killing at the hands of Clayton, but since he couldn\&#39;t bring that about, he instead jumps into his pool of seduction and drowns himself.\nAnd what we learned from this biop, is that Jimmy Whale was a gentleman, a lecherious and cunning one, but still, a gentleman of the old school, and for most of us, we got to know him better than we ever did before, via this splendidly done and excellently researched film.\nIt is apparent that Whale has this tremendous identification with outcasts (monsters), therefore it seems logical to deduce, that for those who liked this film, it really came down to what they saw in it how well they responded to it, just as when Clayton saw the FRANKENSTEIN movie on TV for the first time with Betty, and gravitated toward the film, while Betty saw it as passe, something that wasn\&#39;t cool enough for her to enjoy.\nREVIEWED ON 5/8/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34; Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews &#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;INVISIBLE MAN, THE (director:James Whale; cast: Claude Rains (Dr. Jack Griffin), Gloria Stuart (Flora Cranley), Una O\&#39;Connor (Jenny Hall), E.E. Clive (Jaffers), William Harrigan (Doctor Kemp), Henry Travers (Doctor Cranley), Forrester Harvey (Bill Hall), Holmes Herbert (Chief of Police), 1933)\nOne of the all time fun pictures, with enough ingredients in it to please a wide variety of film fans. James Whale, the director of FRANKENSTEIN (31), saying this one is his favorite film. This was English actor Claude Rains\&#39; American movie debut and vehicle to future stardom, even though he is visible for probably less than 30 seconds of the film, and that comes only at the film\&#39;s climax, who only got the role because Boris Karloff turned it down, afraid that the role wouldn\&#39;t work for him because he wouldn\&#39;t be seen: but Rains\&#39; distinctive voice was all that was needed to bring credibility to the part he will always be remembered for. A film so perfectly and magically done, that is based on the H.G. Wells novel, that is faithful to the book while adding its own flavor of campiness to the story, such as a wonderfully bizarre Una O\&#39;Connor, screaming her head off, as &#34;The Lion\&#39;s Head&#34; inn\&#39;s wife of the owner and hostess to the invisible man.\nA special film such as this one, brings unmitigated joy to those of the 20th century who like to sit in the dark and watch a world of illusions come across a screen, an activity that could have hardly been envisioned a couple of thousand years ago, and is looked upon, even today, with a strange reserve by those who don\&#39;t take their movies that seriously, not understanding just how rewarding it is for those who find certain films so important to them, that it becomes an integral part of their life and they can see the same film over and over again and still derive great satisfaction in what they are seeing. As for me, I could have seen this film as many as twenty times already, starting when I was 12-years-old and first saw it on a TV program called &#34;The Million Dollar Movie,&#34; and I still get a kick out of it and see something delightfully new in it with each viewing. It is especially fun to watch it with youngsters who have never seen it before and are generally unfamiliar with watching a movie in b/w, just to watch the reaction you get from these youngsters, is enough of a charge, as they are perhaps surprised at the fun they are having in watching such a creaky story and its outdated Hollywood version of an old established English country village. It is a film like this one, that can lure you into becoming a bona fide film buff.\nIn the snow a mysterious stranger (Rains) enters the village inn and seeks a room. He is dressed so you can\&#39;t see one feature of him, as he is wrapped in facial bandages and wearing a hat and an overcoat, rubber gloves and sun goggles. The patrons at the bar think he is an escaped convict. The owner of the inn (Forrester), is upset that he hasn\&#39;t paid his bill and is rude to his wife (Una), who wants her husband to get rid of the strange guest, who has turned his room into a science lab and is scaring away the other customers. The stranger, who is the scientist Jack Griffin, just wants to be left alone. He ran to this nearby village, when he realized the experiment that he was working on for the last 5 years, went wrong and he had become invisible, after using a drug called monocaine, which is a flour grown in India that has the effect of a bleaching power, but has powerful side effects when ingested, such as megalomania and permanent invisibility. It was his hope that he could buy some time in this village inn to find a formula for becoming visible again.\nThe gifted director James Whale knew what to do with this story, as his serious sounding but humorous caveat throughout the film is: There are certain things on earth man must not meddle in.\nWhen the police are called in to remove the inn\&#39;s guest who wouldn\&#39;t budge, there is a mixture of suspense and tongue-in-cheek humor in the air, as Griffin unwraps his bandages and to the utter amazement of the policeman and the other bar patrons, becomes invisible, running around the room undetected by them, tweaking them, mocking them, and providing one of the all time great scenes in film history. He goes through the village, playing childish pranks, stealing hats off the men and riding a bike invisibly through the streets. It is only the police chief who is cynical about this, refusing to believe what the people are reporting to him.\nGriffin feels he needs a visible partner to help him with this maddening plan he has, to rule the world by initiating a reign of terror, so he visits his scientific colleague, Dr. Kemp (Harrigan), who is his hated rival and a man of low character, who wishes to steal Griffin\&#39;s wife away from him upon learning of his disappearance a week ago, Flora (Gloria), whose father (Travers) is the scientist that both of them work under. Dr. Kemp is scared out-of-his wits, and the scene is filled with pathos, melodrama, and ironical wit, as Griffin dresses in his unwilling guest\&#39;s robe and pajama\&#39;s and usual bandage disguise, and explains to him that his invisibilty is not perfect, after eating his food it could be seen for an hour afterwards, until it is fully digested, that in the cold air you could see his breath, in the rain he would look like a bubble, that he has trouble walking down stairs as an invisible man, because he hasn\&#39;t quite gotten used to the fact that he is invisible and therefore is very cautious of the downward steps he takes. But he tells Kemp not to fret for him, these are minor problems that will be worked out in due time, and besides, on a clear day conditions are perfect for him.\nHe makes Kemp come with him back to the Lion\&#39;s Head, where he left his invaluable notes. Once there he comes across a meeting being held to determine if the invisible man isn\&#39;t a hoax, as the police chief insists, discounting all the claims the locals are making. This angers &#34;The Invisible Man,&#34; so he slays the chief, and is now the subject of an intense manhunt.\nBut how do you capture an invisible man? Whale has a ball with this police problem.\nWhen the invisible man discovers police all around Kemp\&#39;s house, he realizes Kemp tried to double-cross him and promises to kill Kemp at exactly 10 p.m. tomorrow. This bizarre threat adds to the mystique of &#34;The Invisible One,&#34; as the police believe they have set a fool proof trap for their man, using Kemp as bait.\nThe film comes to its splendid climax in the dreaded snow, with John Fulton\&#39;s ultra-modern, for its day, special effects, adding enormous visual support to the sci-fi story, having the invisible man\&#39;s footprints remarkably appear in the snow.\nREVIEWED ON 5/12/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34; Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LANDSCAPE IN THE MIST (director: Theo Angelopoulos; cast: Michalis Zeke (Alexandre), Tania Palaiologou (Voula), Stratos Tzortzoglou (Oreste), Vassilis Kolovos (Truck driver), Dimitris Kaberidis (Uncle), 1988-Greek)\nNone of us know where we are going, could be the theme for this road movie, which is more intense and somber than most other movies of this ilk. The plot is very simple, a small boy and a slightly older girl want to go to their father, who their Greek mother told them is living in Germany. They don\&#39;t know his name or have his address, or for that matter know if he really exists, yet one day they steal aboard a train and they are heading north, through the Greek countryside, their destination being Germany. Trains are always mysterious places for travelers, they take on their own strange landscape.This Greek travelogue is definetly not a touristy one, the itinerary is frightening, the barrenness of the stations is eerie, the mood is strikingly joyless, as these kids are living in a dream world, seeing in their dreams a father they never knew but deeply yearn for. When they are caught by the conductor as possible runaways and are turned over to the authorities, all they manage to say is that they are going to their uncle\&#39;s place. It turns out that they do have an uncle in this small-town, but when he meets with the police, he tells them that he can\&#39;t take responsibility for these kids, that his sister lied to them about their father, because she didn\&#39;t want to tell them that they were illegitimate.The girl overhears this, but refuses to believe it, running away with the boy, as they continue hitchhiking north.\nThey are picked up by a miserable truck driver, and are subject to his depravity. Their dreamlike odyssey, nevertheless, continuing, ever moving northward. One of the more interesting and better people they meet, is Orestes, a young man on a motorcycle, a roadie for an acting troupe, a loner about to go into the army. He becomes a father figure to the kids, his silence and mythic presence is a tower of strength to the frightened and lost kids, who can\&#39;t open up to him and tell him where they are going, they can only tell him that they are heading north. He vows to help them get on the train, he sees that as his special mission. His youth can be viewed in contrast to the old country dying all around him. His goodness and restlessness represents the hope of the country. The north represents the unknown, a place of childhood fantasies.\nThe question asked, is why carry on, if you can\&#39;t reach where you are going? The subtle answer, probably lies in what lies beyond the mist, there must be something to believe in, even if you can\&#39;t see it.\nThe camera work is stupendous, capturing in total the dreamlike quality of the film. We witness a wedding in the snow, a giant hand of creation being lifted out of the sea by a crane, and the innocent kids gazing out at a world of adults that is incomprehensible to them. The mood is so harsh, even biblical in scope, that when it asks the question in its voice-over, &#34;If I were to shout, who would hear me?&#34; We are left speechless, knowing that we are ruled by fate, that the poor kids, whose plight tugs at our heartstrings, will not be given an easy way out of their predicament. This film is not a soapy Hollywood production, it is a film that is meant to haunt us, to make us ask questions that we cannot easily answer.\nREVIEWED ON 1/28/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;SHIRALEE, THE (director: Leslie Norman; cast: Peter Finch (Jim Macauley), Dana Wilson (Buster Macauley), Rosemary Harris (Lily Parker), Tessie O\&#39;Shea (Bella), Elizabeth Sellars (Marge Macauley), Sidney James (Luke), Reg Lye (Desmond), George Rose (Donny), 1957-Australia)\nKids are notorious scene stealers, and as sharp a performance as was put on by Peter Finch, nevertheless, the kid still stole the show from him, as the native Australian, returning to Australia after successfully building a budding career in England, and from working with Laurence Olivier, and as rumored, having an affair with Mrs. Olivier, should be glad to be home again.\nSHIRALEE could be at times a very penetrating and hard look at a proud and independent man, who has fallen more in love with the Aussie countryside and outback, than he has with settling down and being a responsible family man. Peter Finch is well up to the task of being this rugged individualist, Jim Macauley, who is known as a scagman, someone who seeks only temporary work and is more interested in moving about whenever he sees fit to.\nAt other times, the film drifts off into soapy sentimental territory, becoming contrived and not sure if it wants to be that honest and truthful about the bitter-sweet story it is telling.\nThe story is a rather plain one, Mac comes home to find his wife Marge (Sellars) in bed with the man she is living with, Donny (Rose), while he was away; and, in the same room, is his young daughter asleep, and the room is cluttered with beer bottles. He acts indignant, hears a lecture from his wife that he ignored her, as she says to him, what did you expect me to do, sit here and wait for you forever? He then beats up Donny, puts the little girl over his shoulder and he is back on the road.\nThe girl\&#39;s name is Buster (Dana), and she is cute, tempestuous, and hardy, the best reason for watching this film, as she becomes the Shiralee, which is the aborigine word, meaning a burden, and it is hearbreaking to see her on the road, as no matter what the hardship she shows an unspoken love for her father, who is aloof in his real love for her, but is won completely over by the film\&#39;s end.\nMac retraces his previous routes, and as expected, we see them caught in many a tough situation, as they roam the country\&#39;s back roads, with the father getting into a big fight, meeting up with colorful acquaintances again, meeting new colorful characters, going over some beautiful Australian scenic routes, as the father painstakingly is breaking the little girl into his routine. She takes solace in a doll one of Mac\&#39;s friends gives her, which is used to compensate for her loneliness.\nIt is a movie made by Ealing, a British studio, that actually used mostly a British cast, making the film seem more British than Aussie. It is a film that Disney could have easily made; and, it should be noted that this film was made into a successful television sitcom.\nThe subplot did not play really well, that had Mac being kicked off a farm he previously worked at 7-years ago, even though Buster has a high fever, as the owner of the farm, who despises Mac for making his daughter Lily (Harris) pregnant and then leaving her, feels he has to do that. Mac didn\&#39;t know that she was pregnant and that she had lost the baby.\nThere is also some comedy thrown into the mix, that acts to soften the story, as a couple (Bella &amp; Luke) that are so good that they seem like the were created only for sitcoms, take Mac and Buster under their wing, and some contrived humor is squeezed out, before Mac leaves to get work in another town, and Buster refuses the comfort of a real bed this warm couple offers, and insists she go along with her dad as he searches for work.\nThe crises point of the film comes when Buster\&#39;s mom gets a court date to prove that she would be a better parent than the father to the child, but Buster, when chasing after her father who fails to return home because he is with a woman, gets hit by a car, and it is touch-and-go whether she will live or die, as melodramatics take over and the film is now reduced to being a sentimental weepie, but it is still packed with enough sustaining power to make it a pleasant enough viewing, but no more than that.\nREVIEWED ON 5/12/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;CHARACTER (director: Mike van Diem; cast: Fedja van Huet (Katadreuffe), Jan Decleir (Dreverhaven), Betty Shuurman (Joba Katadreuffe), Victor Low (De Gankelaar), Tamar van den Dop (Lorna te George), Hans Kesting (Jan Maan), 1997- Netherlands)\nThe somber experiences of a Dutch boy growing up during the 1930s in Rotterdam and raised by a house maid mother who refuses her employer\&#39;s offer of marriage after he impregnates her after one time of lust.This dark story is a tale of revenge and hatred for these three characters, as they try to come to terms with each other. It is told in flashback, with a voice-over.\nThe boy (Fedja) succeeds and becomes a lawyer despite all the obstacles of a father\&#39;s hatred, a mother\&#39;s coldness and silence; and, his poverty and illegitimate birthright. In the opening scene, we are left with the impression that Fedja knifed his father to death. The police grill him and, thusly, his life story unfolds. We learn of the boy\&#39;s character: how he is ruled by hatred for his father, making his life focus singularly on succeeding at any cost, even giving up his one chance for happiness by not courting the lovely bookkeeper (Tamar), who works in his office. We never get to fully understand his mother\&#39;s (Betty) character, except that she is an enormously proud person, and shows great strength in raising her son without any help. She does not hate him, yet she displays no affection for him except to protect him with her motherly instincts from the dangers of the outside world, a world she has shut herself off from. She takes in a border, a young communist (Jan), who lends some humanity to her rigid life. We don\&#39;t know why, but she never has another man after her marriage refusal.\nThe father is the most feared bailiff in town, collecting debts and throwing people out of their homes when they fall behind in their payments. His character is shown by his motto: &#34;The law is without compassion.&#34; His bravery is a result of his death wish, is the opinion of those who know him best. He is a man deeply tormented by troubling thoughts of demonic proportions, a character molded out of the Old Testament.\nFedja tries desperately to escape from his karma, but can\&#39;t. The lawyer who hires him (Victor), believes in him and tries to show him some humanity, becoming his mentor and counsel in his bankruptcy hearings. But even he can\&#39;t penetrate Fedja\&#39;s severe emotional problems. The crux of the film is about the battle of wills between father and son, and how hatred reduces the family to have no future. The father is devastated by Betty\&#39;s refusal to accept his marriage proposal. The mother has given up on life and has nothing more to give. And Fedja\&#39;s pursuit of his goal, has left him in a hopeless situation, with no chance for securing love or happiness.\nTremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent story and exceptionally fine performances.This a dark film, and it is grimly shot , reflecting this dire mood. What is troubling about the film, is that no alternative way out of this dilemma was explored. In any case, it is better this way than the usual sentimental Hollywood rags to riches treatment of such a story.This film is more in the spirit of reading someone like Dickens, with strong oedipal emotions added to the bleakness of the story, as it is adapted from a novel by Ferdinand Bordewijk .\nREVIEWED ON 10/23/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;TASTE OF CHERRY (director: Abbas Kiarostami; cast: Homayoun Ershadi (Mr. Badii), Mir Hossein Noori (The seminarian), Abdolrahman Bagheri (Mr. Bagheri, the taxidermist), Safar Ali Moradi (The soldier), 1997-Iran)\nThis is a come to your own conclusion movie, that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution, but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story. It is vividly shot with a cast made up of mostly nonprofessional actors, as the director, Abbas Kiarostami, who many film critics consider to be one of the greatest living film directors around, is known for his use of the long shot, as he uses it to pan the harsh mountainous vistas and the faces of those itinerant Iranians, who are seen through the eyes of a forlorn and, at times, loquacious, middle-aged driver of a luxurious Range Rover, Mr. Badii (Ershadi), who is on a mission that he can\&#39;t find the right words to explain fully its meaning, who wants to kill himself, and whose odyssey, takes us to the brown dirt fields and barren hills of the outskirts of Tehran, as the film is searching for answers to something it doesn\&#39;t know for sure, as it relates to these three disciplines--- the military, religion, and science; or, it could be as it relates to the Kurds, Afghanis, and Turks; or as it relates to one\&#39;s son, one\&#39;s brother, and one\&#39;s father.\nWhatever Badii is searching for, this basically is still a philosophical movie, that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness that hasn\&#39;t been prescribed to them. It also indirectly asks the question, why would any one in good health and being sane, want to kill themselves.\nMr. Badii wants to pay someone to make sure he is dead. That night he plans to swallow enough sleeping pills to kill himself and then he will go lie down in a hole he has dug for himself in the outskirts of town.He asks the various people he meets in his Range Rover, will you come to the spot at 6 a.m. and call out my name? If I reply, help me out of the hole. If I don\&#39;t, cover my body with 20 spadefuls of dirt. Then take my car and there will be 200,000 tomans inside the glove compartment for you.\nWe don\&#39;t really know the reason Mr. Badii wants to die and we know almost nothing about his personal life, except when he mentions to the poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job, that you don\&#39;t know how someone else feels, you may be able to sympathize with them, but you could never understand their pain.\nHe seem to be an upper-class gentleman, as observed by his demeanor and appearance. But again, we can only guess at who he is and why he wants to commit suicide, to the director it is obviously not that important, or else he would have provided us with more information.\nWe first see Mr. Badii drive slowly through the streets of Tehran, as young men approach him asking for jobs as laborers. He then meets some children happily playing in a rusted car, and we see the stark contrasts of Iranian life, such as between the haves (Mr. Badii)-and-the have nots (the laborers), a theme that will run through the director\&#39;s work.\nHe first encounters a laborer as he reaches the outskirts of town, who is on the job, but is presently talking on the phone, in an outdoor phone booth, about his money problems, and Badii tells him he has a job for him that pays plenty of money, but the laborer threatens to beat Mr. Badii up if he doesn\&#39;t mind his own business and go away. He probably thought like I did, at first, that Badii was a pervert trying to pick him up. He next meets a poor worker, in a UCLA sweatshirt he found in the junk pile, who collects plastic bags for the factory to recycle, but expresses no interest in Mr. Badii\&#39;s offer to make a lot of money, saying that this is what he knows how to do and doesn\&#39;t want to do anything else.\nHe gives a timid Kurd soldier a ride back to the barracks and tries to engage him in a conversation, asking him what his army life is like, and starts reminiscing back to his army days, which he says were the happiest days in his life, where he met the friends he still has.The soldier, who was a farmer as a civilian, and says he needs the money, that army pay is not good enough, just doesn\&#39;t want to do it, saying he is no grave digger, and the first chance he gets to run away from him, he does.\nIn his continuing quest, his car almost slides down the steep embankment, as he goes up a hill where only quarry workers are at, and a group of workers without saying anything, quickly come to his aid and push him out of his predicament. Again, the contrast between the men\&#39; silence and the noise from their work is explored.\nWhen he comes across an old Afghani man, who is a security guard for a construction company, that has a gigantic concrete making machine on its premises, he tries to get the old man to come for a ride with him, telling him no one will steal the stuff, it is too big, besides today is a holiday. But the old man doesn\&#39;t want to hear how unimportant his job is, he just wants to do his duty, whatever it may be, as he invites Badii up for some tea, making him climb up an unsteady ladder, which ironically Badii complains is unsafe, and this from someone who is ready to kill himself. It becomes evident to Badii that the lonely old man is not willing to kill him, so he doesn\&#39;t even bother to present him with his proposal, but he turns his attention on the old man\&#39;s young friend, who is just visiting him for a couple of days, and is a fellow Afghani, studying in the seminary. But he cannot do it for the reason that the Moslem religion does not permit suicide, and Badii\&#39;s cogent argument, that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying, just falls on deaf ears.\nAt a particularly depressing work-site, where the dust is whirling around, and the workers all wear masks to help them breathe, Badii sits in his car and seems to be oblivious to all the rocks and bad air around him, and when a worker, who appears to be foreign, politely asks him to move his car, that it is in the way of the bulldozer, he seems unable to move or respond to the worker, as the worker asks him if he is feeling well.\nThe next scene, someone with an older voice, is talking with Badii, having already accepted the offer to do what he wants, as he has a sick anemic child that he needs the money for.\nMr. Bagheri (Baghieri) is a Turk, who talks incessantly, giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch, with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on, and its close-ups on Badii in his vehicle. The table is now turned, as Badii becomes very quiet because he does not have to talk Mr. Bagheri into doing the job, as Mr. Bagheri tries his best to convince him that life is worth living, as he tells him about how his own suicide attempt ended in a failure, how he tried to hang himself on a mulberry tree, but ended up tasting the mulberry. Then he asks Badii, Don\&#39;t you want to taste the cherry? Don\&#39;t you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset, and the stars and the moon? As he offers logical reasons for staying alive, that are indisputable. But Badii is concerned only with going over the details of his plan with Mr. Baghieri, who it turns out works in the museum of natural history, and is a man of science, a taxidermist, who was out on the hills gathering quails to be stuffed. Again, the theme of contrasts is shown, as a man who takes life, is also the one who argues vehemently to preserve life.\nThe women we see all wear head scarves, which to the Westerner, is an archaic way of treating women, but to Kiarostami, he could have shot these women this way as a very subtle dig at Iranian culture, as he shows that even educated women who are working at the museum are clad that way, and one scarved modern woman asks Badii as he drives by, to snap a photo of her and the man she is with. Kiarostami\&#39; point is that all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state.\nAs I was trying to figure out where we were going with this suicide, the film suddenly changed directions, and depending on how you feel a film should be made, might depend on how you felt about what the director did, which was to follow Badii back to his affluent apartment in town, as we are not shown if he took the pills or not, and then we see it is daytime and soldiers are doing marching drills in the hills and then taking a break and joking around with each other, as a film crew is talking to Badii, who is smoking a cigarette, with the film crew indicating that they have just wrapped up shooting the film they were working on, as a film within a film.\nFilms are meant to pose questions and not tell stories, is what the director is now telling us, since questions are more important to him, than anything else, they make us think harder about the things we do.\nMy thought about the death of the linear film, as pronounced by the director, is that, if all you did was ask questions, as valuable as they are in the process of educating yourself, you would still end up being the idiot questioner, if that is all you did, question everything, because somewhere along the line, if you are honest with yourself, you will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe, and that statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film format, and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how a film should be made.Why Kiarostami might resort to this form of filmmaking, at least for this film, could have something to do with Iran\&#39;s repressive government and their long list of intolerances, that if he openly criticized them, it would probably result in no more Kiarostami films for foreigners to adore.\nI\&#39;m a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films, as being the vade mecum of filmmaking, you just try to do what you can, if the film has a magic to it, it will work. I thought the ending of the film was not only a cop out, you don\&#39;t know for sure if Mr. Badii committed suicide or not, but it also took the air out of the story\&#39;s power and made it seem like a tease someone plays on you, first getting your hopes up and then going back on their word. Kiarostami was having fun with the audience, and if you weren\&#39;t in the mood for his jokes, then you might have thought like I did, that it was just too contrived and took away a very good experience I was having, with my imagination working on all cylinders, stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised; and, by ending the film on that false note, and shooting it on video instead of film, it made it seem to me as if this was not a totally-serious attempt to look at ourselves and the society we live in, as I originally thought it was. If Kiarostami thought I needed a break at that point of the film, that I was forgetting that it was just a film I was seeing, then he miscalculated how I felt. But I still believe the film had a potent political message that was delivered subterraneously, a message that is meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life (and at film), and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us.\nAnd, in any case, I know from my past experiences with great filmmakers, that sometimes I don\&#39;t like what I see from them the first time and later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing. So I\&#39;ll leave open the option that my distaste for the film\&#39;s ending will be subject to change, that is, if that is meant to be so.\nREVIEWED ON 5/14/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;PUSHING TIN (director: Mike Newell; cast: John Cusack (Nick Falzone), Billy Bob Thornton (Russell Bell),Cate Blanchett (Connie Falzone), Angelina Jolie (Mary Bell), Vicki Lewis (Tina Leary), Jake Weber (Barry Plotkin), Kurt Fuller (Ed Clabes), Jerry Grayson (Leo Morton), 1999)\nWho\&#39;s the better man? That\&#39;s the real theme of this sitcom comedy/romance film about air traffic controllers in the NYC area, covering its three major facilities, JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark, that is based on a &#34;NY Times Magazine&#34; article about how stressful their job is. As the hot shot traffic controller, Nick Falzone (Cusack), known affectionately by his peers, as &#34;The Zone&#34;, who is very confident of his ability to make sure planes land safely, with the keen ability to solve problems quickly, who is also known as being a rapid fire talker possessing a razor sharp mind. Nick\&#39;s life changes for the emotionally worse when a new controller is transferred into his shift, also a hot shot, or a loose cannon, as Nick prefers to think of him, he is the soft-spoken mystery man, Russell Bell (Thornton), who battles with Nick for top spot, as he displays an extraordinary ability to keep the air lanes clear, without slowing the planes down, so the airlines have no complaints to the supervisors about their planes not being on time. This is called &#34;pushing tin.&#34;\nThe film becomes a contest as to who is the better man, Nick or Russell: 1) As they vie on the job, even wrestling on the floor, for top spot. 2) In racing their vehicles. 3) In their basketball shooting. 4) In each other\&#39;s marriages. They don\&#39;t care for each other, as each has different things to work out in their life and each finds something about the other one that disturbs them.The other two characters in this basically four character movie, are Connie Falzone (Cate), Nick\&#39;s suburban wife and former high school sweetheart, who speaks with a fluent Long Island accent (quite different from her stronger Elizabeth 1 role), and Mary Bell (Jolie), who is the 19-year-old alcoholic, knockout, tattooed wife of the 40-year-old Russell, who relates to the other controllers\&#39; wives, as wife number one, as these women refer to themselves by the numbered wife they are to their previously divorced spouses, such as wife number one, two, three, four, or five.All the women\&#39; performances are cute, but they don\&#39;t have too much else going on for them to make their characters interesting.\nThe male stars keep the film flying along. Billy Bob might just be the best character actor in the movies today. He keeps his character zen-like and puzzling, despite being hampered with an inept script, as he tries to outwit the script that makes everything he is doing seem contrived, as he offers us a contrast to Nick\&#39;s slightly off-beat regular guy role.Nick is the one who is supposedly contented with his family life and his job, that is, until Russell pulls the rug out from under him and he begins to unravel in all area\&#39;s of his life. I just wish Cusack would lose that coy smile he seems to bring with him in every role he has, it is starting to wear tiredly lame on him.These stars make their characters seem more real than they have a right to be, because the story is just too thin to carry much weight on it, except to follow its commercial instincts and provide the audience with enough obvious action sequences to keep the pace of the film moving at jet speed, allowing hardly any time for one to sit back and think about the real turbulence that could have been experienced about traffic controllers\&#39; stress from the job.\nThe British director, Mike Newell (DONNIE BRASCO and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL), has a sound ear for comedy and a way of capturing the tense work scene in the control tower. The chaos and controlled confusion in the tower, and close camaraderie waffling in the air between the controllers and even their bosses was fun to watch, as well as giving the audience a chance to be looking over their shoulders at the computer screens they work with, giving an accurate and colorful view of the job they do.\nThe film chose not to go in the direction of political insights, so no mention is made of the Patco strike (1981), where President Reagan fired over 11,000 controllers of the 17,000 in the nation, creating a shortage that still exists, even though replacements were almost found for all those layed off, but the flights have increased many-fold since then, leaving them with the same stressed-out conditions they complained about before, and with less experienced men on the job. It is really astonishing that a film about traffic controllers wouldn\&#39;t even mention the most startling event that ever happened to them.\nIt was the director\&#39;s ear for comedy that made the film enjoyable, despite the sitcom feel to this story that, at times, made me cringe with disappointment, wishfully thinking that this capable cast, including the fine supporting cast, could have really done well with this subject matter if they were only presented with a potent script instead of this trivial one, that laid all the stress problems on the laps of the controllers\&#39; twisted personal lives, such as when Nick screws up, nearly causing two crashes within a short-time span at work, all because his wife left him over his infidelity with Russell\&#39;s wife and Russell retaliated by screwing his wife, while the real cause of stress, the unimproved work conditions at the airports, is not even broached.\nIn any case, the humor and the banter among the workers was constantly funny, but the low-key, understated wit of Russell was even more hilarious than the workers\&#39; gallows humor, it was laugh out-loud humor, as in the macho driving scene, where Nick is making an effort to get to know his rival, to find out up-close what he is up against, as he invites him out for donuts after work, and starts racing his car and passing cars and trucks dangerously on the crowded Long Island Expressway, and he can\&#39;t even fluster Russell, as he stops for a light, and as the light turns green, he sits exasperated with his hands folded over the wheel, and Russell quietly says, the light isn\&#39;t getting any greener, and so, he puts on one more burst of daredevil riding and pulls into the donut shop, and all Russell could say after that harrowing ride is, good, the shop is open... I\&#39;m afraid that scenes such as this one, are the only redeeming features of this comedy/romance that saved it from crashing.\nREVIEWED ON 5/16/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;Q: THE WINGED SERPENT (director:Larry Cohen; cast: Michael Moriarty (Jimmy Quinn), David Carradine (Detective Shepard), Richard Roundtree (Sergeant Powell), Candy Clark (Joan), Larkin Ford (Museum Curator), Malachy McCourt (Police Commissioner), 1982)\nA flirtatious window washer, on a skyscraper, has his head lopped off while on the job. One cop asks another, How did that happen? I dunno, maybe his head came loose. A tenured college professor is found flayed in his hotel room, while on a visit to NYC, as the cops rule out suicide since there is no reason for a tenured teacher to kill himself. A woman sunbathing in the nude on the roof of her building is attacked by a giant bird and is carried off to be flayed and dumped in the roof storage area of the Chrysler Building, where the birds are nesting and hatching future attacking birds in giant eggs. Is there a connection between the flayer and the birds? Detectives Shepherd (David Carradine) and Powell (Richard Roundtree) are assigned the case, and Shepherd immediately puts two and two together and comes up with this logical deduction, that this must be a ritual killing. So he sees the Museum of Natural History\&#39;s curator and hears his explanations on myths of sacrifice, and it now comes obvious, even to a skeptic like him, that this must be the Q in the title of the film, Quetzecoatl, the flying Aztec god, that the curator is talking about, who can be prayed back into existence and kept alive with the blood that must be given willingly by the victim, or else, the ritual performed by the priest (the flayer) is meaningless, and the bird or God, can\&#39;t gain strength from the blood.\nMeanwhile, petty criminal, ex-junkie nerd and convict, the quick-talking, Jimmy Quinn (Michael Moriarty), tries out for a piano singer\&#39;s gig in the bar his girlfriend, Joan (Candy), works at, using a piece a black man who killed seven white men taught him how to play when he was doing hard time; but, he doesn\&#39;t get the job. So he takes the other job he was offered earlier on in the day, to drive a getaway car in a jewelry heist. Quinn is a born loser, so natch, the job goes sour, when the hoods make him come into the store with them and give him a gun, even though he asserts that wasn\&#39;t part of the deal. When things get fouled up inside the store, he walks out with the diamonds, but doesn\&#39;t have the keys to the car, and then gets hit by a cab, as the bag full of jewels disappears in the street, whereas he will have to walk with a limp for the rest of the film, while being pursued by the mobsters and tracked down by the police, because the other hoods get caught in the store and rat him out. But in hiding out from the mob, he inadvertently stumbles upon where the bird nests.\nThis is real funny stuff. The special effects for this low-budget film are surprising well-done. And things are happening so fast, that there is no time to think about what is happening, since logic has already been swooped away by that fuckin\&#39; bird, as that is how it is referred to by NYC\&#39;s finest, as they scratch their heads over this one, gathering 43 witness reports of blood dripping on them from skyscrapers and a huge bird that is seen in the sky, carrying off construction workers; and, on a luxury building, a rooftop swimmer is swooped away by a huge bird in front of everyone else in the pool.\nQuinn, while running from the two hoods who want the jewels, leads them right into the claws of the nesting bird, giggling at their misfortune of being eating to death, and realizing he has his meal ticket, if he plays his cards right, as the police question him about the jewelry heist, but are really concerned about all those mysterious killings.\nWhat is amazing, is how well the story and the routine investigation of the cops into this bizarre newspaper headline story go together, as Carradine takes it all in as just another day at the office, while Quinn couldn\&#39;t be more goofier and likable, smiling like he won the lottery when he blackmails the city into giving him a million bucks for his info, stating that he also wants a Nixon-like pardon.\nPowell, as the straight gung -ho cop, has the honor of teaming up with an undercover cop, disguised as a mime, as they chase the lunatic priest over NYC rooftops, after the priest fails to get the not-too-swift Quinn to pray with him, so he can voluntarily give his blood to God.\nI loved the explanation given for what God is: an invisible force we fear, and in our vanity, we try to make it human.\nSometimes the low-budget nonsense films that don\&#39;t take themselves that serious and just go out there and do their funny thing, are much better than those serious films that win all those critical praises from the illustrious establishment critics, and this is one of those films, in the genre of someone like an Edgar Ulmer. All you have to remember about this film, is that what you have seen, is all that there is to see, there are no hidden messages or deep symbolic meanings for you to ponder.\nREVIEWED ON 5/17/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;LA BELLE NOISEUSE ( director: Jacques Rivette; cast: Michel Piccoli (Frenhofer), Jane Birkin (Liz), Emmanuelle Beart (Marianne), David Bursztein (Nicolas), Gilles Arbona (Balthazar), Marianne Denicourt (Julienne), Marie Belloc (Magli), 1991-Fr.)\nRivette has created a work of art from a short Balzac story about art, &#34;The Unfinished Masterpiece.&#34; Art and life are viewed as one and the same problem, in this film about a wealthy, once successful artist Frenhofer (Piccoli), as he searches for his sanity through his art, who is now troubled that he can only paint a masterpiece or nothing, and for the last 10- years the later was the result, except for some trivial self-portraits. His wife Liz (Birkin), who modeled for his former masterpiece, is concerned that something tangible has gone out of the marriage, though they are still a loving couple, blessed with a young daughter.\nFrenhofer\&#39;s art agent, Balthazar (Gilles), brings along a young struggling artist Nicolas (David), to visit the Frenhofer mansion at Languedoc. He is an admirer of Frenhofer\&#39;s work and wishes to meet him. There is also the young artist\&#39;s attractive live-in girlfriend Marianne (Emmanuelle), of the last three years, someone he met when he saved her from throwing herself in front of the metro. She writes children\&#39;s books, but does not really consider herself a writer. It is just something she does so she could be independent of Nicolas.\nThe two artists intellectually engage in a discussion of what art means to them. But when Nicolas and Marianne are together, they try to picture themselves living in Freno\&#39;s mansion, the place is so enormous and quiet, beyond what either of them says they are currently looking for in life; though he offers no comment about what he really thinks, while she openly disdains the place.\nAfter being encouraged by a visit to Freno\&#39;s atelier, a place he hasn\&#39;t been to in two months, the guests view his paintings and warm up to their conversations with the host. The younger artist brashly states, &#34;That for him, art is about taking risks, it is a bold stroke, something that stands out.&#34; Freno declares, &#34;That art to him is when the forest and sea submerge as one.&#34; For Freno, &#34;In order for the truth to come out of a work of art, there must be blood on the canvas.&#34;\nFreno feels inspired by his guests\&#39; visit; he is especially taken with Marianne, he sees something in her besides her lovely ass and breasts and beautiful face, and when Balthazar suggests that he start again on his unfinished masterpiece, using Marianne as a model, Nicolas agrees for her without asking her for her permission.\nLa Belle Noiseuse, which we are told, is the title of the masterpiece, is about a 17th century lady of the world who was kind of nutty in the sense that she was difficult to figure out, who is referred to as being someone who is a &#34;ball-buster.&#34;\nWith Freno back at work and the air filled with tension, you might as well say, let the games begin, and they do, but under Rivette\&#39;s masterly direction what happens is what you might expect to happen but not in the way you expected it to happen, with the result being a fascinating look at how an artist tries to get at the essence of what he is doing, struggling with all the human emotions of passion and intellectualism, as those around him become in one way or another part of his work, as their jealousies, sexuality, and life ambitions come to the surface, in what transpires over the three day period he works with the nude model.\nEvery character has a part to play in the dynamics of the artist\&#39;s creation, as he struggles to relate with his recalcitrant (she is steamed at Nicolas for not consulting her, saying &#34;you sold my arse&#34;) and difficult model (this mansion reminds her of boarding school where she was sick all the time, until they eventually kicked her out of the school), as he finds that he must use his wits to get her to do what he wants her to do, because she is determined to be who she is, that is, until she becomes hypnotized under the artist\&#39;s careful scrutiny and finds it impossible to wear the mask in life she has previously worn. The new question becomes, who is she now?\nWhat makes for a captivating depiction of an artist at work, are scenes such as these, where one\&#39;s sense of time is lost, and the length of the picture, (it is 240 minutes) does not seem wasted even for a minute, as we watch and become part of the creation, starting from scratch, and actually are hearing the artist\&#39;s scratching sounds on the canvas for minutes at a time with no action on the screen but to view him work and watch him manipulate the model into the pose he wants, even when she complains that he is hurting her.\nThat the truth is cruel might have seemed like bullshit to her when Freno first said it, but now that Marianne is getting a grip on herself, she is no longer scared of all the tension that is in the studio and what is going on with her relationships-- that is, with Nicolas and Liz, as well as with the strange attraction she has for the 60ish and much older artist.\nThe girl-to-girl talks with Liz do not seem to do anything for her. She is just curious how Liz met the artist. And when told, they met in a cafe, and that he fell for her first before painting her, she seemed satisfied in knowing this but showed no concern of ever becoming a friend to Liz. Liz, on the other hand, is aware of what her husband is like, she knows he will behave properly with the model while working with her, she realizes that his work is everything, but she also knows there is a danger in these two working together, that sparks could fly, that he is looking for something in the model\&#39;s beauty that he can no longer find in her; and that\&#39;s what is upsetting to her, as she tries to play the role of supporter of her husband, by making sure Marianne feels reassured to continue modeling, yet guarded that something could go wrong that might upset her own relationship with Freno.\nMarianne tells Freno that she is through with Nicolas, even though, he is the only man she can live with, she must move on. Nicolas is consumed with jealousy, admitting that it is he who needs Marianne now, not like the reverse situation when they first met. He wants her to stop modeling and return with him to Paris. She not only refuses, but she takes a guest room in the Frenhofer\&#39;s, leaving him alone in the inn they were staying at.\nFrenhofer is stuck. He is filled with self-doubt if he can ever paint again. He says, &#34;You get stuck in what you are searching for--- you get possessed by it.&#34; But he explains, &#34; it is fear that makes him paint, for him painting becomes a tactile experience whereby his fingers are led unconsciously.&#34;\nMarianne asks him, &#34;Why &#34;me&#34; naked in front of you, why not Liz&#34;? She goes on to say, &#34;I need to understand this&#34;... It seems the situation has reached a point of no return. Every character is now playing out his emotional trump cards. The artists are struggling with what is not clear inside themselves, as their wounds are opened and their vulnerabilities seem to be devastating.\nLiz tells her husband, &#34;You are sad because you are no longer young, 10- years is a long time to stop painting and to now go on. You will only destroy what happened before you start over.&#34; There is a hint of a possible affair that might have taken place between Balthazar and her ten- years ago, that seems to be the cause of the tension we feel among the three of them.\nIn contrast to Freno, Nicolas can\&#39;t stand the solitude, he is afraid to be alone with himself. When left alone, he takes comfort in the company of his sister (Denicourt), who joins him at the inn where he is staying.\nLiz says, &#34;for Freno, it is the art of it, it is the capturing of a whole life in a painting--- it is that thing that makes art shameless, that is what matters to him. It is as if one can see one\&#39;s whole life passing in a flash, like it might be for a person drowning.&#34;\nWhile discussing their relationship, Nicolas states to Frenhofer, &#34;the only enemy of an artist is a bad painting.&#34; He gets his digs in by insulting the artist\&#39;s lifestyle as comical. So the camaraderie between the two artists seems to be genuinely plausible, in the sense, that they do understand each other, that is, as far as their work goes. With Freno, in the position of control in his life, he is able to patronizingly say to Nicolas as he departs, &#34; I like you, don\&#39;t ever change.&#34;\nThe last shot is with the agent, talking numbers with Frenhofer, deciding how much they will get for the masterpiece. The implication being, as Balthazar invites Nicolas and his sister to dinner, that Nicolas is next in line, he will profit from his art in due time.\nThe acting is exceptionally good by everyone. Piccoli as the artist is mesmerizing, while Emmanuelle is both beautiful and intelligent, offering a special quality about her that makes it possible for us to believe that a masterpiece could come out of her poses. The only thing that struck me as odd, is that the final masterpiece drawn, supposedly by Bernard Dufour, did not appear to me to be a masterpiece, but a rather ordinary work. The picture itself is the masterpiece; that is, the creative process itself, was convincingly done, by a director who has the skills and knowledge to tell such a story and never allow the story to be wavering from its lofty position of significance, as anything but an honest intellectual effort, a search for the truth within.\nREVIEWED ON 11/25/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;THE SILENCE OF THE SEA (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Howard Vernon (Werner Von Ebrennac), Nicole Stéphane(The Niece ), Jean-Marie Robain (The Uncle), Ami Aaröe (Werner\&#39;s fiancee), 1947-Fr.)\nA German Lieutenant, Werner Von Ebrennac (Vernon), is stationed in France during the time of the occupation and moves into the rural village cottage of an elderly, scholarly gentleman (Robain) and his niece (Nicole).They take a vow of silence toward the German intruder, sitting by their fireplace night after night when the officer returns from his duty, never saying a word to him during his entire stay with them. The officer never shows his animosity towards them as he uses their silence to fill in details about what he is thinking: his love of music, his life story, the girl he almost married, his love of French culture, and his belief that this occupation will be good for both countries, he says it will be like a marriage. His political naivety (in civilian life he is a musical composer) and underestimation of the evil government he represents, comes to light for him when he meets with close friends who are in Paris to negotiate the political arrangement between the two countries. It is then that he is shocked into realizing the barbaric designs that are intended by them to reduce the world to be submissive to a dominant Germany, the aim being to rip the soul out of each country it conquers. His more benevolent ideas, for the mutual countries to co-exist, are sneered at by his cultured German friends. Fed up with this, but resigned to the fact that there is nothing he could do about it, he volunteers for duty in the war zone of WW11.\nThe old man has left a copy of one Anatole France\&#39;s books out for him to see just as he leaves for the front, the quote reads, &#34;That it is a soldier\&#39;s duty to disobey a criminal order given by his superiors.&#34; The niece also yields a muffled &#34;adieux&#34;, that he might have heard, but does not respond to. That he leaves just at a time when they are questioning if their silence was the right thing to do, adds an argument that Melville might have been particularly interested in, by showing that all parties have to get rid of their hatreds before they can communicate with each other to extract any positive results.\nThis film was made so close to the end of the war, that it seems to be trying desperately and as intelligently as it can, to understand what went through the minds of those who participated in those infamous days of occupation and how it is possible to begin a healing process between such sworn enemies. In any case, it captured the climate in France during the war and the humiliations the French went through in the hands of their captors.\nThe Nazi holocaust and its diabolical war machine, were not broached in any of the officer\&#39;s soliloquys with the couple held hostage in their own home. But how would he have treated them if they were Jews, remains unanswered. It is through this officer, that Melville symbolized the best of the German\&#39;s intentions, someone whom there is some hope for if the world is to have a saner future.\nWhat happened in that occupied house was a one way dialogue, with silence winning and losing. Winning in the sense, that there was no other way to conduct oneself with dignity when your enemy takes over your homeland, and the dignity of those who formed the Resistance Movement is undoubtedly honored by Melville for the rightful stand they took. Melville was in real-life a member of that Movement. Losing, because silence means you can\&#39;t voice what is in your heart and mind, and by remaining silent it can be interpreted as a tacit acceptance of defeat and an unwillingness to call out for what is right and wrong.\nIn the end, it was the German officer who remained silent by going off to fight a futile war, a war which made no human sense from his side of the fence.Which means, when the chips are down, he is still a believer in the motto: My country, right or wrong.\nMelville\&#39;s film is stimulating and perplexing, yet it is simple in tone and in human spirit. It gave me chills to watch how natural it all seemed; firstly, because the protaganists were so real and the situation was so menacing; and, secondly, everything happens in such a matter of fact way, enhanced by being shot in the harsh and convincing tones of black-and-white, giving the film a certain disquiet with the sea in the background that is unsettling to behold.\nREVIEWED ON 2/26/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39;s World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;THE SCHOOL OF FLESH (ECOLE DE lA CHAIR, L\&#39;) (Director: Benoit Jacquot; cast: Isabelle Huppert (Dominique), Vincent Martinez (Quentin), Vincent Lindon (Chris), Marthe Keller (Madame Thorpe), Dani=E8le Dubroux (Marine Thorpe), Francois Berleand (Soukaz), 1998-France)\nAdapted from a novel by Yukio Mishima, THE SCHOOL OF FLESH tries to get us to believe in the sexual relationship and power play between a wealthy middle-aged Parisian woman Dominique (Huppert), who is in the fashion business. She falls madly in love with a much younger, Arabic lower-class boxer, bartender and bisexual hustler named Quentin (Martinez), and is willing to pay him to live with her. His great sex is supposed to be the reason she loses control of herself and can\&#39;t be without him and will do anything for him, even as he acts nasty and repugnant and they have nothing in common that they can talk about, only sharing in an animal-like lust. This is asking a lot to believe, and though it is possible, it would have been more possible to believe if Quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch, because he sure couldn\&#39;t act, and since he is the focal point of all the attention, able to have his way with either men or women, we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen, instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldn\&#39;t see it.\nJust what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship, that would make it interesting ? I\&#39;m afraid I don\&#39;t have the answer, since I can\&#39;t find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it, as I tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle, and just watched for the street scenes of Paris in the background, which I found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself, even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers, and this is being said by a big fan of Isabelle Huppert, who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career, but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance.\nWe first see Dominque pick Quentin up in the gay bar he is working at, after several intense eye contacts, where a former gay lover and employee of the fashionable gay bar where Quentin works, Chris (Lindon), explains to Dominque, as he is badly emoting his part as a queen, the lure and treachery and violence of Quentin. But this does not stop this ill-conceived relationship from taking place, as they spend a night together, first in a power struggle to see who is boss, as she takes him to a fancy restaurant which he pretends not to like, and then he takes her to the arcades, which she honestly detests, this culminates in a night of lovemaking, where sex is acclaimed as the sole keeper of the relationship, in fact the sex is so good that he refuses payment for it, but she insists, wanting to keep him on her payroll, not willing to take the chance of losing such a good catch. The only problem with this, is that we didn\&#39;t see how good the sex was, we had to take the word of the actors that it was so good, as dialogue came out of their mouths that is totally forgetable or regretable or whatever, but their love was not passionate or credible.\nOnce Quentin is paid for, that is his so-called debts are paid off by Dominque to Chris, who is probably his pimp, the story limply moves along, as some subtext to the already lame story is introduced, about wealthy friends of Dominque\&#39;s meeting Quentin through Dominque and Quentin marrying their spoiled daughter with her parents\&#39; approval, that was unconvincingly done.\nThere is one line from the film that summed up how I really felt about what I was seeing, when at a fashion party for Dominque\&#39;s wealthy Parisian fashion clients, Quentin tells her, &#34;seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke.&#34; Quentin must be psychic or something, because he was just regurgitating what I was thinking about the characters in this film.\nREVIEWED ON 5/11/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;SWINGERS (director: Doug Liman; cast: (Mike) Jon Favreau, (Trent) Vince Vaughn, (Rob) Ron Livingston, (Sue) Patrick Van Horn, (Charles) Alex Desert, Heather Graham, Deena Martin, Katherine Kendall, Brooke Langton, 1996)\nAn independent film, shot for around $250,000, that lacks a cutting edge, something indie films should not leave home without. It sure looks like a Hollywood studio film to me, but with a little bit of spice thrown in to give it some oomph. It is a story about swingers, which should be a revolting topic and is, for most of the film, nevertheless, there is humor to be found. The boys are out to have some fun, all wrapped up in their libidos, ready to score with the opposite sex. The gang is made up of actors looking for work, coming to Hollywood to be where the action is. The star of the film, is the one who wrote the screenplay, Jon Favreau (Mike), who plays this whiny, ex-New Yorker, who wants to be a stand-up comedian but is the only one of his swinger friends who is not funny, he is, instead, disconsolate because he left his &#34;honey&#34; 6 months ago to be in LaLa land, jump-starting his comic career. He now feels lost without her, finding every other chick he meets to be no match for her. Unfortunately, we have to hear this whining for most of the film, until he acts natural, and bingo, something good happens to this dude, who I must fess up and say, I felt nothing at all for.\nThat girls are attracted to the swingers, speaks volumes for how sex and love are intertwined in our culture. And the boys will be boys theme is played here to the hilt, as sex is always foremost on their mind. For Mike, it has to be both, sex and love. That he is clearly the winner at the end, gives the film the right perspective it needs, not to fall into its own cool lingo trap.\nPreoccupied with himself, Mike always thinks he is being sensitive, even when telling the girls he means it when he says how much he misses his &#34;babe,&#34; so naturally, he fails to attract their interest. In contrast, the swingers that make up his group, roam Las Vegas, the bars of L.A., and the home parties they get invited to with a steel will for scoring as many chicks as they can.\nMike\&#39;s best pal is Trent (Vince). He sets the tone for the boys. Encouraging them when they are down, but he is caught in his own deceits, vainly thinking he can pick-up any girl he wants. He represents the heart and soul of the swingers and gives the film a comedic tone, that at times, as silly as it is, is downright funny. I loved his philosophical advice to Mike, from one swinger to another, advising him that you cannot get a woman to come back unless you\&#39;re willing to forget her, after which, of course, you don\&#39;t care if she comes back. It is also riotous to hear the loud mouth Trent, call Mike, &#34;money&#34; every time he wants to cheer his pal up. The other swingers are, Rob (Ron Livingston), Sue (Patrick Van Horn, yes, Sue is a boy), and Charles (Alex Desert), who act to support each other, looking out for Mike in particular, thinking he desperately needs to get his head together in order to be back with them swinging.\nWhat irked me most about the film, was how the filmmakers seemed proud that they ripped off Tarantino\&#39;s style of film, claiming everyone rips off everyone else. The problem with that logic, is that this film doesn\&#39;t look original, it looks and feels like all those other Tarantino clones. It smacks of wannabe actors being made into a film by wannabe directors and writers.\nIf you have a strong stomach and can take the staleness of the story, you might find it funny enough, and actually enjoy it, realizing, in all seriousness, that this is the way it is for many heterosexuals, and it is always hard to change the way it is, no pun intended.\nREVIEWED ON 2/11/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;CHARULATA (director: Satyajit Ray; cast: Madhabi Mukherjee (Charulata), Soumitr Chatterjee (Amal), Shailen Mukherjee (Bhupati Dutta), Shyamal Ghoshal (Umapada), Gitali Roy (Manda), Bholanath Koyal (Braja), Suku Mukherjee (Nishikanta), 1964-India)\nReportedly, Satyajit Ray said, of all the films he directed, that this was his favorite. It is based on Rabindranath Tagore\&#39;s controversial novella, depicting a lonely wife\&#39;s flirtation with her husband\&#39;s younger cousin, Amal (Soumitr), that takes place during the Victorian era, when India was under British rule, as the story unfolds in an opulent Calcutta household, in 1879, giving it a spicy Bengali flavor.\nThough the plot is simple, the human emotions are not, and the chance for observing how one feels is maximized in the very perfect structure that Ray has created for the film, as Charulata (Madhabi), called Charu, is the neglected and sensitive wife of a newspaper man, Bhupati (Shailen), who is consumed with the politics of the day, with his paper\&#39;s logo being, &#34;The Truth Is What Survives,&#34; as he takes pride in his Anglican witticisms and the fact that he is not one of those idle rich, but is working hard and doing something that is important. At one point of the film, his face turns to glee as he is in his newspaper\&#39;s press room and he exclaims that he just loves the smell of the ink press, there is nothing better in the world than that smell.\nThere is a certain feeling to this b/w illustriously cinematographed film, that reflects the belief Ray has, that life is a continual rhythm of birth and death, one is complete because of the other.What breaks out in streams of genius (love) are what volcanically erupts in this rhythmic living flow, and what gives sustenance to new beginnings, is the force of nature that wells up, as reflected in Charu, as the flighty and playful, 23-year-old Amal, the opposite of his practical 35-year-old cousin, who is encouraged by him to keep the lonely Charu company and tutor her, which Amal does by reading her poetry that awakens her hidden nature, as it allows Charu a chance to realize for the first time in her life what love for someone else feels like as it churns inside her, quite unexpectedly, while being with Amal.\nAmal is too self-absorbed and loyal to his cousin to notice or, to even, contemplate what is happening, until later on in the story, and at that time, he reacts by leaving the house and not acting on his true desires.\nThe huge house is Charu\&#39;s domain, as she prates around it with her hand-made embroidered slippers and her opera glasses, which she coquettishly uses to spy on people, as she is bored- silly, talking prattle with Manda (Gitali), the wife of the newspaper\&#39;s manager, whose main pleasure in life seems to be when she is having ice cream. From her second floor bedroom window, Charu will view her kindly but preoccupied husband from this distance with the same equilibrium she reserves for the glances she imparts on the strangers passing by.\nAmal writes his literary piece and gets it published in a prestigious magazine called &#34;The Lotus,&#34; which inspires Charu to let go of her inhibitions, as an inventive bit of photography is used by Ray, undoubtedly influenced by the French New Wave cinema, where we see Charu\&#39;s mind in a vortex of activity, recalling her past experiences in the village she was brought up in. This turns into her literary piece, published in the other prestigious magazine &#34;The Philanthrope,&#34; which surprises her husband when his friend Nishikanta (Suku) tells him this as he is celebrating with his newspaper friends the victory of Gladstone and the Liberals in England, elated about this because the new government will benefit India more than the former ruling party, the Tories, did.\nThe pivotal point of the film is reached by the betrayal of Bhupati by someone he completely trusted and made the manager of the newspaper and keeper of the money, Umapada (Ghoshal), who fails to make payments to keep the paper going and absconds with the stolen money, bankrupting the paper and breaking the heart of Bhupati, who feels that by losing the paper he has lost his co-wife.\nThis is a film that is visually poetic, stunning in its apperceptive recognitions of life in the raw, without any wasted movement exerted, with expressive gestures counting for unsaid dialogue and untold physical encounters replaced by a nuance, such as, by a romantic notion, as Charu has on a swing, just by a toss of her head upwards and she is seen in a swoon, and a deliberate word from her will slowly be turning into a potion that is magically brewing, as it is taking charge of all her pent-up emotions, as we imagine that we actually can see what is taking place inside the heads of the would-be lovers, even if nothing explicit materializes.\nThe final thrust of emotions erupts inside the already broken-hearted Bhupati, as he recoups his senses and composure by vacationing at a beach, where his wife plucks the first gray hair from him, and he returns to the house, satisfied that he has worked out a plan with his wife, that he run the political part of the paper they will attempt to resuscitate, while she will run the literary part.\nOnce home, opening the letter from Amal, learning that his cousin is living in Madras and will accept the arranged marriage that Bhupati worked out, only brings uncontrollable tears to Charu, as Bhupati awakens for the first time, recognizing what is happening between him and his neglected wife, and what Amal means to her, as the camera just stays with him and her, in a final fade out freeze-frame shot, as they join hands like Michelangelo joined Adam\&#39;s hand with God, and a perfect picture is forged in our memory, its feeling so deeply evocative, its expressive mood so longingly embraced, that we can only be stunned by its sheer exquisiteness, for we have come across a chaste romance that is so subtle and delicate that we find it hard to compare it to those in other films, knowing we have struck pay dirt with this one, for we have seen how a great filmmaker can bring life out into the light, like only a master artist can; and, we have seen a film that is timeless, that will never be outdated, as it has already proven by passing the test of time, appearing just as modern in 1999 when I saw it, as it did in 1879 when the story took place, and as it did in 1964 when the film was made.\nREVIEWED ON 5/7/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;CHILDREN OF HEAVEN (director: Majid Majidi; cast: Amir Naji (Ali\&#39;s Father), Mir Farrokh Hashemian (Ali), Bahareh Seddiqi (Zahra), Nafiseh Jafar Mohammadi (Roya), Fereshteh Sarabandi (Ali\&#39;s Mother), Kamal Mir-karimi (the Principal), Behzad Rafi\&#39;i (the Coach). 1997-Iran)\nIn this kidpic, which is a very safe movie to make in today\&#39;s Iran, as even with the intolerant dictator Khomeini dead, and a more liberal regime in its place, there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story, because of strict censorship, and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in, is in a type of film like this one, where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system, as everything is seen through the children\&#39;s eyes. The only thing, is that I couldn\&#39;t pick up any subtle attacks against the regime. Maybe it was too subtle for me to pick up, or maybe there was no dissensions, this was just meant to be a tear jerker of a film.\nThe story is guileless. It is about a lost pair of shoes and a shared pair of sneakers, which if it was an American film and didn\&#39;t give me a chance to see a country such as Iran, which I am unfamiliar with, but curious to see how it looks under this new regime, I would have been really disappointed at how weakly structured it was. But because it is Iran and I am aware how difficult it is to make a film under censorship there, I am more tolerant of its flaws than I ordinarily would be.\nWhen Ali, the nine year old, fails to come home with his younger sister Zahra\&#39;s shoes that he retrieved from being repaired at the shoe shop, this left the children with a big problem in their life, because their God fearing, uneducated but honest parents, who are impoverished, owing money to the landlord and the grocer, are in no position to get the child a new pair of shoes. Ali must get the shoes back, but he is not aware that a blind garbage collector took them by mistake, so rather than burden the parents with further money problems and get a beating besides, and also unnecessarily excite his very sick mother, who on doctor\&#39;s orders must not work, Ali devises a plan where he shares his sneakers with his sister, so they both can go to school, but this is his and was her only pair of shoes; and, as they go to school in different shifts, it is possible for them to pull this switch off if their timing is perfect, but since their timing was off, he keeps getting caught by the principal coming late to class, and besides, his sneakers are much too large for her, making their plight more dramatic. Why he doesn\&#39;t tell his teacher about this problem, I don\&#39;t understand, especially since his teacher seemed like a kind man, and, since this might be a problem that is not that uncommon in a school where a lot of the children are poor. But, then again, if he did that, that might have taken away the reason for making this slight film, in the first place.\nMost of the film takes place as we watch these two darling children run to make their classes, while switching Ali\&#39;s sneakers in an alleyway, giving us a chance to see that most of the other children where their south Tehran neighborhood is, are also suffering from severe money problems. At one point of the film, we will see how the rich live, in the north side of Tehran, in luxurious roomy houses, with clean drive-ways, and inter-coms, and gated entrances, with lush gardens; and, the problem the rich kids are shown to have, is from boredom, but when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, the film seems to be saying, all kids are kids, as we see how easily Ali becomes friends with one of the rich kids.\nIf this film was made in the States, its theme could be, the NY state lottery theme, &#34;You gotta be in it to win it.&#34; As the kids try to solve their dire problem by having the athletic Ali, enter a marathon race for the city school kids, where third prize is to win a pair of sneakers; and for Ali, he has to rely on his gym teacher to enter him because he was unaware of the race until it was too late to enter it himself. During the race, the filmmaker pulls out a bagful of cinematography tricks and borrowed shots from other directors to make the race an exciting one, but a race that left me unimpressed with what kind of point the filmmaker was making.\nIf one, could summarize, how this feel good Iranian version of that old Hollywood standard formula works here, tugging at the audiences\&#39; heartstrings every chance it can get, as quickly as tears fall from Ali\&#39;s wide oval eyes and a frown covers Zahra, as whenever bad news comes her way, which is most of the time, we see a frown appear on her. I assume, what the film is trying to say, is see how you must solve your problems on your own, don\&#39;t blame it on the government.\nThe few times Zahra does smile, her smile is a very warm and generous one, like when a little schoolgirl classmate of hers, who happens to be the daughter of the blind garbageman, who has given her Zahra\&#39;s shoes he picked up by mistake, returns the pen Zahra lost, which was a gift to her from Ali, for not telling their mother that he lost her shoes. He got the pen from his teacher for being an excellent student. I guess the point being made here is, both girls can be generous and have learned how to live with their poverty.\nThe father\&#39;s poverty reflects the director\&#39;s own background, which is why the family is so touchingly portrayed but in such a manipulative manner, that it fails to be as convincing a portrayal as it could have been, if done in a more free flowing form.\nThe father is seen as a true believer, never questioning authority, deeming everything to be in the hands of God, whereas his religious beliefs are so strong, he would not even take a piece of sugar that he is chopping up for the Mosque to have for his tea.This display of moral rectitude, reveals how simple things can be if you just have faith and perseverance to endure life\&#39;s hardships. Is this what the film is really trying to say?\nWhen the father takes Ali by bike to the rich part of town, seeking work for them as gardeners, it is an eye opening experience to see them pass through a modern and sleek city. They get lucky through Ali\&#39;s ability to talk to the rich people in the other side of town and land a job that pays them well, but as to be expected, in this most manipulative of films, things quickly reverse, as the father\&#39;s brakes fail and the bike crashes, so all the money they made, goes for hospital bills and new brakes.\nChildren of Heaven does humanize the Iranian people, and show them to be a warm people, able to help out others in need, as when Ali brings soup his mother made to their elderly neighbors. But as an impactful film, it falls on its face with a thud, unable to make heaven seem to be a real place for children, where everything that is bitter is shown to be really fine despite what appears to be not so fine: rich people are not bad they can be nice, schools are not that rigid they can be accomodating, religion is unquestioned but that is because it is necessary, being poor can make you sad but it is not the worst thing in the world, and obedience is sometimes difficult to understand but it can be rewarding.\nREVIEWED ON 5/18/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;WHO\&#39;S GOT THE BLACK BOX? (Route de Corinthe, La) (director: Claude Chabrol; cast: Michel Bouquet (Sharps), Claude Chabrol (Alcibiades), Jean Seberg (Shanny Ford), Paulo Justi (Josio),Christian Marquand (Robert Ford), Saro Urzì (Kalhides), Anthony Pass (The killer), Maurice Ronet (Dex), 1968-France)\nThis is a goofy spy comedy, filled with asides to Greek tragedy, that you would expect to see supporting character actors such as Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet in, but their character roles are taken up by such diverse oddball characters as, Anthony Pass, playing a very pasty looking killer, a Peter Lorre type of role, as he is dressed in a white suit, with a straw hat that has a red ribbon around it, always with a rose in his lapel, as he takes great enthusiasm in his job, doing it with a panache reserved for high camp, yet he is particularly menacing as a villain, even as he jumps for joy on certain occasions and raises an effeminate eyebrow, as he waits in a hotel room ready to kill the heroine.\nSaro Urzì, as Mr. Kalhides, is the crime boss and owner of the marble foundry, where all the espionage takes place, acting piggishly vulgar, willing to halt his execution of Shanny Ford (Jean) for the possibility of a little romance with her, as he is seen eating legs of lamb during various scenes, while wiping his mouth with the palm of his hand, and who could be fittingly forceful when exuding an air of comic sinisterism. As the one giving the orders, the big boss, he is a less portly version of Sydney Greenstreet, playing the type of role once reserved for the mirthful Greenstreet.\nClaude Chabrol plays Alcibiades, a character who could be in a look alike contest with other Fidel Castro contestants, and be considered the favorite to win, as he starts the pot boiling with his hot tip to Robert Ford (Marquand), if Ford will give him 1,000, he will tell him where to locate the black boxes that Ford is looking for. Ford is an Agent working on cracking the case of where the black boxes that have been smuggled into the country are, as they are capable of dismantling radar systems and destroying missiles. Don\&#39;t ask too much more about the plot, it is not particularly pertinent, and some explanations about what this film is about, were obviously snipped off at the cutting room. But an unclear story and poor dubbing quality of most of the non-English speaking actors, does not really hamper the absurdity presented on screen, because it is done in such a way, that it defies any critical commentary, having a dark humor about it that is funnier than hell.\nThe bizarre opening, and it is bizarre and ticklishly funny, has a magician billed as &#34;Socrates the world\&#39;s greatest magician&#34; being stopped at the border as he tries to get into Greece, smuggling in a black box, but gets caught by the border guards who procede to beat him in order to get information out of him, as he chooses to die from his own hand, taking a cyanide pill, but not before he goes into a Shakespearian soliloquy that tells his captors that it is too late, there are already 15 black boxes in the country.\nChabrol has gone to absurd extremes of humor in this commercially driven screwball comic/mystery, that has the Agents working for the Greek government, at least I think that is who they are working for.The one in charge of them, is a lazy, sleazy, and mediocre bureaucrat, named Sharp (Bouquet), aptly named because he is a dull wit, who is clueless about what is going on, as he confronts the two Agents working for him, the imaginative but usually wrong, Robert, and the more steady Dex (Ronet), who like Sharp, has his eye on Robert\&#39;s appealing wife, Shanny, only he doesn\&#39;t get his face slapped like Sharp does by her, as Sharp makes too much of an overt pass at her. Jean Seberg, the much maligned actress, is just terrific in this breezy role, showing a certain amount of vulnerability and courage and sex appeal, and an eye for comic timing, as she takes over for Robert when he is killed just before he was going to tell her the info he has about the black boxes, and they were to celebrate the news with champagne and love making.\nThe road to Corinthe, the European title for the film, is the road to the marble foundry owned by Kalhides. It is the place where there is this great mix of intrigue and murder and comedy, as the black boxes are discovered there, hidden in the statues\&#39; heads, and as Kalhides says, if you think I\&#39;m not imaginative enough to put them someplace else, you are wrong, because some of them I have put in the base of the statue.\nThe danger Shanny finds herself in, as the villains go after her, is routinely filled with one surprise after another, as she gets a ride from a simple-minded truck driver (Justi), who constantly eats sardines and could use a little romance from her, as she pumps him for info about his boss, the ever-present Kalhides, who murders the trucker, just because he kept him from killing Shanny, which was a visually bizarre scene, showing how he has her placed on a giant hook on a crane, lifting her up and ready to dump her into a rock pile.\nDex saves the day, finding it in his heart to go against his boss, Sharp, who orders Shanny to go back to New York; but, Dex decides to risk losing his job by reluctantly helping Shanny fight the keepers of the black box. It is a wonderful B movie experience, that rips deliciously into the spy film genre and comes away with a bundle of laughs for all its awkwardness and a ridiculous ending to a story that fails to make much sense. I think Chabrol hit it best, when the opening epigraph states, &#34; I do not ask you to believe it, but I suggest that you dream about it.&#34; Well, maybe, you don\&#39;t want to dream about it, but if you daydream about it during the time of day when you are a little bored with things or upset over something, the absurdity of this film should bring a smile to you.\nREVIEWED ON 5/19/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;PATHER PANCHALI (SONG OF THE LITTLE ROAD) (director: Satyajit Ray; cast: Kanu Bannerjee (Hari), Karuna Bannerjee (Sarbajaya), Uma Das Gupta (Durga), Subir Bannerjee (Apu), Chunibala Devi (grandmother), 1955-India)\nAn understated masterpiece in simplicity and poetical mood, the first part of Ray\&#39;s trilogy, THE WORLD OF APU, based on the popular 1934 two-volume novel by Bibhuti Bannerji, as Ray studies the life of a very poor family, trying to survive on an income of next-to-nothing in a rural village in Bengal. PATHER PANCHALI covers the early childhood of the hero of the story, Apu. We, as observers, seem to become a part of the family and share in their dreams and hopes, wondering what can be done to make life better, as we ask ourselves, is it best to leave everything in the hands of God, believing that God knows best.\nWe first become acquainted with the utterly adorable Durga (Uma), as she steals fruit from the local orchard and is detected by the spiteful neighbors, who blame her mother Sarbajaya (Karuna) for not teaching her the difference between right and wrong. The mother hears this being said while she is doing her laundry by the communal well, and confronts her daughter with this information, realizing that she is taking the mangoes and guava to her very old, hunchbacked, toothless and unwanted grandmother (Devi), who is devilishly charming. She has gotten under Sarbajaya\&#39;s skin, making her unhappy that the playful Durga loves to help her out. Mother accuses grandmother of being a bad influence for the child; and, the reason she is being thought of as a bad mother by the neighbors; so she asks granny to leave, claiming she can\&#39;t stay here any longer, that she is spoiling the child.\nApu (Subir) is born, and grandmother returns to live with the family. Durga is childishly playful with her wide-eyed younger brother (who represents all the hopes of knowledge and success for this family). She is constantly teasing him; but, also, she shows great affection for him. They seem to have a natural bond.They are both trapped in their environment and have only their childhood dreams to help them escape their poverty.The father, Hari (Kanu), is a failure as a provider for the family. He is a dreamer. He thinks of himself as a scholar, who will one day become famous for writing plays. He also conducts religious services to try and meet expenses. But this is not going well, the house is badly in need of repairs, and his wife constantly nags him to get some money. He is of such a good nature, that he can\&#39;t stand to argue with anyone or ask for something, even if it is rightfully his, putting all his fate in God. He can\&#39;t even ask his boss the reason why he isn\&#39;t being paid; or, as his wife reminds him, he didn\&#39;t even fight for his rights to the fertile orchard, which would have softened life for the family to a considerable degree, when his inheritance of it was challenged because his brother had huge debts.\nTragedy comes to the family when the father has to leave the local area to seek work and fails to return for months, leaving the family in an impoverished state. During a monsoon rainstorm, Durga develops a chill and because the family lacks the proper medicine, she dies. This takes the heart out of the family, as the father returns too late to be of any help. Death has already come to their grandmother, after feeling rejected by her family, she goes out to the hidden fields and is found starved to death by the children who went there to look at the trains passing by.\nThe final scene shows the family moving away from the isolated village their family has lived in for generations, opting for the bigger city of Benares, where it might be possible for them to better their lives.\nSatyajit Ray\&#39;s old-fashioned and slow developing film, graced with the sublime sitar ragas of Ravi Shankar, is unpretentious and starkly beautiful in its depiction of the human condition just as it is, giving relevance to the lives of these ordinary people, without the need to be arty about it, as the characters find in their hearts how best to transcend the situation they are in. This film should be a magical lesson in film-making for those modern filmmakers who think they must inject heavy doses of symbolism to get their point across.\nREVIEWED ON 12/1/98\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;STAR WARS: EPISODE I--THE PHANTOM MENACE (director: George Lucas; cast:(Qui-Gon Jinn) Liam Neeson, (Obi-Wan Kenobi) Ewan McGregor, (Queen Amidala) Natalie Portman, (Anakin Skywalker) Jake Lloyd, (Jar Jar Binks) Ahmed Best, (Shmi Skywalker, Anakin\&#39;s mother) Pernilla August, (Yoda) Frank Oz, (Mace Windu) Samuel L. Jackson, (Darth Maul) Ray Park, (Chancellor Valorum) Terence Stamp, (Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious) Ian McDiarmid, (R2-D2) Kenny Baker, 1999)\nThe new Star Wars trilogy, as a prequel to the Star Wars saga, will go back in time a full generation to tell the story of Anakin Skywalker, the innocent boy who will one day become the dreaded Darth Vader, who was the father of Luke Skywalker, the young farmboy who became a hero in the struggle to overthrow an evil empire and had to confront one of the Empire\&#39;s staunchest henchmen, Darth Vader.\nIn this movie, that goes beyond the boundaries of what a movie is, because it has become a trademark name that is as easily recognized as any popular brand name is; if I mentioned KFC, you would know that I am talking about a fast-food chain that sells fried chicken (ugh!), and if I mentioned Star Wars (ah!), the same familiarity would ring a bell with you. Since the movie first surfaced in 1977, it has been a very popular film, basically over-taking many other types of films that took on the moral battle of good and evil, such as the Western, and it created a new myth that does not challenge the old myth, but incorporates pieces of mythology not only from the Judeo-Christian roots of the Bible, but from the Eastern religions, as well. It has become so commercially successful a film and enterprise, that even though the film cost about 115 million dollars to make, its profit margin is a sure thing, since it has merchandise deals tied into its release, that are estimated to be around 3.5 billion dollars.\nWith this in mind, there can be no ordinary viewing of this film, since it is already hyped and promoted beyond any reasonable level of expectation, it is therefore hardly likely that it could meet such expectations, even with its fanatical fan base, willing to stand on long lines for a long time in order to get tickets and who will most likely see the film a number of a times, and a public that is primed and ready for the product. How many times will viewers want to see it, is hard to gauge at this early date, though what is guaranteed, is that it will draw large crowds and pump life into the movie industry, as many will see this film as an event, therefore making it critic-proof and ensured of being a legendary film no matter what might be perceived of it on screen.\nWhat takes place on screen, if I can consider myself, a voice of moderation on this subject, is not as terrible a storyline and acting job as one could be led to believe by listening to some film critics, nor is it as great a film as many unabashed fans might think, who feel taken with the innovative special-effects, and are really caught up in the aura and excessive exuberance the total film\&#39;s package presents to them, from John William\&#39;s recognizable Star War themes, to some original musical scores he added, as special for the film. There should be something in this film for everybody to like, especially in a THX theater, where the digital sound system and wide screen is best suited for viewing it. The tremendous effort put into the details and scope of its project, makes it seem stupendous at times, and, even throughout the film, when there are lulls in its story, it still sets a very galactic mood, that is trance-like and illusionary in a positive hypnotic sense, but it does suffer, at times, from being too talky and lacking enough emotions and depth in its story and in its characters, and is scripted with a banal dialogue, plus there is no romance in it, which makes it a film that is more geared to a younger audience, an audience that will be around to follow all the other episodes that will surely come forth.\nAs a positive feature of the film, it is not interested in gratuitous violence, and for that it scores high marks, as there is no blood in it, as all the action scenes involve mostly robotic things being dismantled.\nAs we read the screen for the opening scene, we learn that two Jedi are off to arbitrate a dispute caused by the Trade Federation against the planet Naboo, that is being interfered with unjustly by the Federation, who are blockading it. The two Jedi sent, are master Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), who is a first-timer to the Star Wars series, and his apprentice, Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who was played by Alec Guinness in Episodes IV, V, and VI. They encounter difficulties and get caught in a trap sprung by the evil Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid), who wants to take over the Galactic Republic, and they are forced to use their lightsabers to fight their way out of the jam, which they successfully do, then realizing that they could use someone familiar with this planet to be their guide, as they escape Naboo, they use this thing they came upon when entering Naboo, someone named Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), a non-stop talking and jittery alien, who is some sort of a combination of a frog, who acts like a cartoon creature that children could gravitate to, but whom I found somewhat offensive because of his speech patterns, which were subservient and stereotypical, like Hollywood sometimes uses to depict certain ethnic groups, only in this case, he is only a representative of these Gungan creatures on Naboo, except he did talk in a West Indian patois.\nAfter the Jedi rescue the 14-year old Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) from the planet and her favorite droid, R2-D2, they are forced to land, due to broken parts, in a remote desert planet called Tatooine, that is not part of the Federation. Here the Jedi meet Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave child, born by means of immaculate conception, working for a junkman that has the parts to fix the space craft. Qui-Gon Jinn recognizes in Ani, the possibility of him being &#34;The Chosen One&#34;, that is, a special Jedi, with a tremendous potential in the Force, though there is, also, a sense of uncertainty about him. Darth Maul (Ray Park), is the evil force, with Jedi-like powers, who is sent here by Sidious to track and kill the Jedi and prevent help for the people of Naboo.\nThe pace of the film picks up with its most innovative addition, an exciting and, I might add, dizzying racing sequence featuring &#34;pod&#34; space ships, as Ani has to win the race to gain freedom for himself and for the Jedis to get their needed space craft parts, as a wager is made with Ani\&#39;s junkman boss on the pod race. This is pure video game stuff, that should thrill its younger audience, perhaps more than it did me, but it was effective and added something new to the Star Wars legend.\nWhat gives Star Wars all its charged up energy are its great duels, with lightsaber weapons, as good versus evil is clearly the theme that propels it, and here the duels are accomplished in a top-notch fashion, better than in other episodes, as the villain, with a painted black-and-red tattooed devil\&#39;s face and short horns, and menacing sneers and graceful martial-arts movements, Darth Maul, battles the master Jedi, admirably portrayed, by a low key Liam Neeson, in a role that he doesn\&#39;t seem to be having much fun in, but is, nevertheless, convincing as a wise Jedi, teaching his more rambunctious apprentice Jedi, Ewan McGregor, the ropes, as they both have a chance at dueling with Darth Maul.\nDelving into the evil nature of politics, there is the dual role played by Ian McDiarmid, as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious, cast perfectly as a shadowy villain and a hypocritical senator, who in future episodes will become Emperor Palpatine and should provide more chills for viewer\&#39;s to reckon with. Without its frightening villains, Star Wars would be stripped of its soul.\nSome of the actors did not impress me enough as the above mentioned. It is probably not fair and not nice to criticize a youngster like Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker, but I thought, that though he was sometimes bearable to see on the screen, as when he played with his computer toys, he was, nevertheless, miscast and did not have the skills to pull off the difficult role he was asked to fulfill. Anikin\&#39;s mother, the great Swedish actress, Pernilla August, is just right for the part; in fact, she is too good for the part, because she makes the boy seem very amateurish and not caring enough when he is teamed with her and can\&#39;t respond with the proper emotional responses expected from his role, while she is fluid and graceful in her role, even though she is stuck in a wooden part.\nThere were non-distinguished cameos by Samuel L. Jackson and Terrence Stamp, that have neither added nor distracted anything from the film. I would have preferred seeing unknown actors in those minor roles, giving them a chance to get known and earn some &#34;bread.&#34;\nSome of the more exciting scenes, that weren\&#39;t crammed too tight with every computerized gizmo Lucas could throw at us, so that we were literally choking on too much alien and droid consumption, came from the just gorgeous and eye pleasing set designs on the planets, such as the submerged underwater city on Naboo, filled with dangerous sea monsters, and a Coliseum-like stadium on Tatooine, where the &#34;pod race&#34; transpired, covered by talking head sport\&#39;s personalities. Then there\&#39;s Coruscant, the Republic\&#39;s capital - a planet where the single city encompasses the entire globe.With its soaring skyscrapers and a sky filled with exotic spaceships and its views of the world, that was just too stunning to fully grasp. That is where the council chamber is, where Queen Amidala makes a plea for her people, amidst the overwhelming effects of the Senate chamber floating in space. All these space landscapes gave the film all the color and spectacle it could ever need, making it a most entertaining and enjoyable movie experience, which is really what this movie is all about anyway, since I find it difficult to get too worked up over its so called &#34;new mythology,&#34; Joseph Campbell blessed or not, since this movie only expresses what is just a shell of what myths can mean to a society. Be that it as it may, I do understand that many feel that what is missing in today\&#39;s society, is some kind of positive myth, that there is something that has gone wrong with our culture, and this film does offer some encouragement for those who feel movies have caused a certain amount of degeneracy in this country\&#39;s cultural war, and they should be pleased that Lucas\&#39;s film reasserts, his personal belief, that good can triumph over evil, as many feel restless and unsure about the world they live in and need reassurance that we have the same positive values other generations of Americans have had, and they should look forward to seeing a film such as this one, that has such a rosy outlook.\nAnd again, it should be remembered that this is an action film, that lives for its battle scenes, that has the &#34;bad guy&#34; droid army fighting the &#34;good guy&#34; army of Naboo, in a computer game war, as the victorious Naboos feel the pride and relief of victory over their enemy, for the moment, as the film ends with the insidious Senator Palpatine taking over the Galactic chancellorship.\nIt is a movie about the taming of nature in the future but made for the age we live in, and will be remembered by future movie viewers, not for its trite dialogue, but as a step up the ladder in our technical and computer skills, and in our deep yearnings to find hope in the world we live in. It seems regretable that we have to wait three more years for the next installment of these episodes to be released. I would say that this imperfect film, is still, a not-to-be missed film, and even if it has become tied-in with corporate America, nevertheless, George Lucas used his great technical skills to make this film as artistically good looking as he could, not aiming to make an exploitive film. And for that, we should all be grateful. I have immensely enjoyed the film for what it was and was not overly concerned about what it was not.\nI think it is fair to say, that when you plunk down your money and see this film, you will be getting your money\&#39;s worth.\n&#34;May the force be with you!&#34;\nREVIEWED ON 5/19/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n=A9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;HARD EIGHT (director: Paul Thomas Anderson; cast: Philip Baker Hall (Sydney), John C. Reilly (John), Samuel L. Jackson (Jimmy), Gwyneth Paltrow (Clementine), 1997)\nThere are many stories that can be told in Las Vegas about those who go there to chase their dreams. This one has a reflective mood and a quiet sparseness to it, that gives its lonely characters a chance to either grow as the story develops or for them to become clearer about who they are and what they are doing.\nWe can see Vegas at night (or is it day), with its bright lights, as we scrutinize those on the low end of the gambling hierachy scratch out a living in this casino town. Las Vegas can arguably be, America\&#39;s alter-ego, even if, that city is a sharp contrast to what the rest of the country is like. But it does offer a lure for foreign and American visitors to see how the free wheeling, capitalist country, they imagine America to be, operates, when it lets its puritanical hair down.\nIn many ways, this film reminds me of Melville\&#39;s wonderful film, BOB THE GAMBLER, as the old pro, with style and old-world charm, Sydney (Hall), teaches the young neophyte gambler, John (Reilly), how to eke out a living from gambling. How to do it smartly, with class. It only differs from Melville\&#39;s film, in the violence that ensues, as HARD EIGHT moves, reluctantly, into noir film dimensions, where no bombardment of bright neon from the swank casinos can hide the darkness present in the characters\&#39; hearts, whose dreams have been poisoned and compromised by the dire circumstances they find themselves in. While, Melville\&#39;s film, retains an almost unbelievable lightness to it. First time director, Anderson, revels in the nuances of his protagonists, with a need for them to be respected and thought of as tough minded, prepared to go as far as killing someone in order for them to protect what they consider valuable.\nSydney treats John to a coffee and a smoke in a diner, after Sydney finds John sitting slumped down and unkempt in front of the diner. He offers to help him out, no strings attached, if John will just tell what is troubling him. John says he needs $6,ooo to pay for his mother\&#39;s funeral. The conversation between the two is guarded and minimal, and we are left to wonder why this older, sophisticated, seasoned gambling pro, would want to help out this youngster, as a father/son relationship begins to develop. The answer comes toward the end of the film, though we never really learn his pyschological reasons for doing what he does. So we are left tantilized with this mystery man and his impeccable manners, wondering who he is, realizing that he is not a St. Francis type of savior, but probably some kind of wise-guy, who seems to have a certain worldly wisdom that he can dispense to someone who is willing to trust and follow him.\nThe two of them head for Vegas in Sydney\&#39;s car, as Sydney stakes John to some money and teaches him how to gamble small time, a skill he will need to learn if he wishes to stay in Vegas. The Las Vegas scene, where the dim-witted John operates the scam Sydney taught him, is an actual scam of the casino. It gives me great delight to see the casino get ripped off, as John works his $150 into $2,000 worth of credit and a free room and amenities. I wonder if this scam really works!!!\nA couple of years go by and John has come to idolize Sydney, as he feels contented with what Sydney has done for him, feeling right at home in Reno, attracted to the alluring but dumb cocktail waitress and part-time hooker, Clementine (Gwyneth), in whose conversations with Sydney, we get a look at what Las Vegas is like without all the glitter, as its inhabitants are caught in the dark web Vegas spins. Jimmy (Jackson) is a friend of John\&#39;s, who works security inside for the casinos, but who does not impress Sydney as being anything but a sleazy loudmouth and a sure bet for trouble.\nThe final scenes involve the trouble John and Clementine get into after getting married, and how Sydney discretely helps them, while Jimmy plays a part in uncovering Sydney\&#39;s past, something that he can\&#39;t run away from, as we, at last, find out why Sydney is doing all this for John. The acting is more than credible, it is superb, as it is just right for the atmosphere it sets. The sparse dialogue helps give the story an intensity that is riveting, giving off the impression that there is something deeper happening than there is. The characters make this film happen. It is a good first effort by the director, who has told a tight story and told it well, holding our interest with a fresh approach to an old story.\nREVIEWED ON 1/8/99\nDennis Schwartz: &#34;Ozus\&#39; World Movie Reviews&#34;\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Tom Guiry, Mike Vitar, Patrick Renna, Chauncey Leopardi, Karen Allen, James Earl Jones Director: David Mickey Evans Producers: Dale DeLatorre and William S. Gilmore Screenplay: David Mickey Evans and Robert Gunter Music: David Newman Released by Twentieth Century Fox\nEight boys, led by Benjamin Rodriquez (Mike Vitar), make up a sandlot baseball team in Southern California during the late fifties. When Scotty Small (Tom Guiry) moves into town, he doesn\&#39;t know how to catch or throw, despite the best efforts of his stepfather to teach him. That all changes, however, when Ben befriends him. Now, with their ninth man, the sandlot group is a full team. However, although their little field is a great place to play ball, it has its dark secret, for beyond the home run fence lurks The Beast, some kind of fearsome dog about which frightful stories abound.\nKids and adults will enjoy THE SANDLOT, but for different reasons. Children will find in it an adventure with a sense of humor that they can both relate to and find in an escape from the real world. Writer/director David Mickey Evans hasn\&#39;t forgotten what it\&#39;s like to be a boy in the middle of summer with nothing to do but swim in pools, pal around, and play ball.\nAdults, especially men, will find in the movie a sense of almost-poignant nostalgia. The story is told WONDER YEARS-style, with a modern day baseball announcer looking back on his childhood (the narrative is at times too reminiscent of Kevin Arnold\&#39;s ramblings). As is frequently the case when we look back on our past, things are tinted by a pleasant glow that leaves behind only the better parts of the memories. This is the feel that THE SANDLOT strives for, and mostly succeeds in attaining.\nThe common theme bridging the age gap in the audience is baseball. This is a world where the game means everything. There is no arbitration, no salary disputes, no 8 million dollar contracts. In the world of THE SANDLOT, baseball is still America\&#39;s number one national pastime, and, in the closing scenes with James Earl Jones, it\&#39;s easy to get a sense of the greatness that underlies playing ball.\nThose that have a distaste for baseball will probably find little to like in this movie. While it isn\&#39;t necessarily written just for fans of the game, enjoying baseball--as well as having some memories of playing on any level--will enhance the pleasure of watching THE SANDLOT. Sure, the movie gets silly at times, and the second half isn\&#39;t as engaging as the first, but since the entire story is a fond collage of memories made more grand by the passage of time, it\&#39;s easy to forgive such faults.\nTo classify this picture as a &#34;male film&#34; is to do it a great disservice. THE SANDLOT is no more a movie for men and boys alone than FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is just for women. Even though all the main characters (except Scotty\&#39;s mom, played by Karen Allen) are boys doesn\&#39;t mean that women can\&#39;t appreciate what happens on screen. Memories of childhood are frequently gender-independent. Men might have the inside track of some elements of nostalgia touched on by THE SANDLOT, but they don\&#39;t have a monopoly. And humor, as well as the love of baseball, are universal.\nThere will be those who will find this film a too-silly fantasy, but they have either missed or chosen not to feel the magic that THE SANDLOT weaves. With the exception of some mild profanity, there\&#39;s little in this movie capable of offending. THE SANDLOT is an excellent choice for a family night at the movies. The previews for it may look bland, but this is one occasion when clips are unable to do more than scratch the surface of the mood and story from which they have been extracted. Predictable as the movie is, the FIELD OF DREAMS quality is not the only thing to like about THE SANDLOT.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Stevie (Robert Carlyle) is an ex-con from Scotland struggling to start anew. In an attempt to change his life, he takes on a construction job in North London where he meets an assortment of others who, in one way or another, are just like him. He has no place to live, and doesn\&#39;t make enough to rent a flat, so his co-workers happily appropriate a &#34;squat&#34; (an illegally occupied place to live) for him. Soon after, he meets Susan (Emer McCourt), an aspiring singer with a lot of heart but very little talent. RIFF-RAFF moves on from there, detailing a short period in the lives of Stevie, Susan, and the workers on the construction site.\nWow. RIFF-RAFF is a strikingly powerful film that combines a biting sense of humor with an uncompromising, true-to-life look at the lot of England\&#39;s working class. While movies like this are often maudlin and sometimes depressingly difficult to watch, in this case, director Ken Loach (whose previous efforts include KES and HIDDEN AGENDA) has guided his production down a narrow trail that perfectly balances comedy and drama. It\&#39;s a daring move and the film succeeds because Loach pulls it off.\nOften, watching RIFF-RAFF is like seeing a home video. The realism is astonishing, and the background on the production makes it apparent how much trouble was taken to make it so. Writer Bill Jesse (who died at the age of 48 and to whom the picture is dedicated) incorporated his own experience from years of construction work, and Loach casted only actors who had actually worked in construction. Says Loach, &#34;The realism stems from Bill\&#39;s writing and the people in the film. We tried to get everybody who had experience on building sites because they all had to work--they all had to know how to do the job.&#34; In addition, it\&#39;s apparent that everyone involved knew how to act, as well.\nRIFF-RAFF contains one of the most unusual romances in recent memory. It\&#39;s an earthy relationship, bounded by uncertainty, poverty, and drugs. Nowhere is the Hollywood mentality of how to handle lovers in evidence. Like everything else in the movie, their interaction is handled with an eye and ear towards mimicking real life. Every line of dialogue between Stevie and Susan rings true.\nSpeaking of dialogue, RIFF-RAFF is in English, but Fine Line Features has chosen to subtitle the movie (in English) for American consumption. Why? The heavy accents of the working class are more than occasionally difficult to understand. Personally, I found the subtitles mostly unnecessary, but they will be invaluable to those unfamiliar with the guttural English used in this picture.\nBest of all, RIFF-RAFF is not a downer. In addition to an overall lighthearted tone, there is enough comedy to keep this movie upbeat. There is a social message, but it doesn\&#39;t bog down the film, perhaps because everything is told from the perspective of members of the lower class who view their lot pragmatically. No attempt is made to contrast the circumstances of the workers with those of the more-wealthy (a theme that has been done many times before), so missing is the seething sense of indignation and moral outrage that often accompanies films such as RIFF-RAFF. For example, when one worker loses his job, instead of making a display of upheaval and anguish, he simply shrugs his shoulders, says goodbye to his fellows, and walks off, never to be seen again.\nIn RIFF-RAFF, Ken Loach has fashioned a world that takes a few moments for the viewer to become immersed in. But once that displacement has occurred, the movie takes on a vivid life that will not be easily dispersed by the rolling of the end credits and the intrusion of reality. This is not a film of sudden shocks and emotional turbulence, but it is forceful and exceptionally worthwhile nonetheless.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Date Released: 4/23/93 Running Length: 1:42 Rated: PG-13 (Mature themes, sexual situations, language)\nStarring: Alan Arkin, Matt Craven, Diane Lane, Bill Paxton, Elizabeth Perkins, Kevin Pollak, Sam Raimi, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Kimberly Williams Director: Mike Binder Producers: Jeff Silver and Robert Newmeyer Screenplay: Mike Binder Music: Miles Goodman Released by Touchstone Pictures\nA group of eight friends gather together at the camp where they spent several halcyon summers two decades ago. The camp director, Uncle Lou (Alan Arkin) has invited them back for a final get-together as he prepares to close the camp. Of course, there are various interpersonal dramas that have to be resolved. The marriage between Matt (Vincent Spano) and Kelly (Julie Warner) is on the rocks, a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of Matt&#39;s old flame Jennifer (Elizabeth Perkins). Jack (Bill Paxton) is trying to come to terms with his past. A year after her husband&#39;s tragic death, Beth (Diane Lane) is still trying to recover. Jamie (Matt Craven) brings alone his fiancee Gwen (Kimberly Williams), who is ten years his junior.\nThere are some pretty good laughs in this film. One hilarious sequence involves Sam Raimi (the director of such films as the EVIL DEAD series) attempting to transfer baggage from a canoe to a dock. In another scene, Bill Paxton relates the humorous events surrounding his first erection. Both of these instances, as well as a few others, had the entire audience in stitches.\nUnfortunately, the good-but-uneven sense of comedy and some excellent performances cannot camouflage the shallowness of the plot, the ineptness of the direction, and the pitifully juvenile dialogue. This movie desperately needed someone competent to take control, and writer/director Mike Binder is clearly not that person. Someone in high school could have crafted better lines for the characters, and Binder is obsessed with close-ups. He too often uses them in the most inappropriate of places, diluting tension and weakening interaction between the actors.\nThe story is simplistic and the character conflict weak. There isn&#39;t an original moment in the film. Coming-of-age stories have been done so often that for one to make an impression, it needs to find a new angle (PETER&#39;S FRIENDS, Ken Branagh&#39;s recent film, although clearly superior to this production, fell into the same trap--little that&#39;s new). INDIAN SUMMER doesn&#39;t even attempt to strike out towards new ground. It finds a comfortable, cliche-filled groove and sits there.\nThe ensemble cast does a marvelous job from top to bottom. Alan Arkin, the consummate professional, is wonderfully dry as director of the camp. Kevin Pollak puts his wit to good use, although his one-theme jokes become tiresome after a while. Sam Raimi, not known for his acting, gives a credible performance as the glassy-eyed, inept Stick.\nThe actors are so good, in fact, that despite being given paper-thin characters and embarrassing lines, they almost pull it off. Now and then, I found INDIAN SUMMER drawing me in simply because these performers are nearly perfect. All of them have been in good projects in the past and doubtless we will be graced by additional fine performances in the future. If there&#39;s a reason to see INDIAN SUMMER, and it&#39;s a very slim one indeed, it&#39;s to see the cast.\nINDIAN SUMMER is Mike Binder&#39;s semi-autobiographical tale about summers that he spent at camp. Obviously there&#39;s a lot of nostalgia involved for him, but he fails to get it across to the audience. Cheap cinematography tricks like graying out the film won&#39;t suddenly cause the audience to wax sentimental. Binder fails in both the directing and writing fronts and if he hadn&#39;t chosen such an exemplary cast, this could have been a real disaster. As it is, INDIAN SUMMER is just a singularly unremarkable and uninteresting movie.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Date Released: varies (limited distribution) Running Length: 1:47 Rated: NR (Nudity, sex, language, mature themes)\nStarring: Trisha Todd, Karen Trumbo Director: Nicole Conn Producer: Pamela S. Curi Screenplay: Nicole Conn Music: Michael Allen Harrison Released by Demi-Monde Productions\nClaire Jabrowski (Trisha Todd) is a California author who has reached recognition based on titles like LIFE CAN RUIN YOUR HAIR. To write her next book, she has decided to spend some time at an all-female Pacific Coast writers\&#39; retreat. She arrives there to meet her roommate, Dr. Noel Benedict (Karen Trumbo), the author of the infamous THE NAKED TRUTH and an avowed lesbian. Noel and Claire are as different from each other as two women can be, and that\&#39;s the cause of inevitable friction. Where Noel is neat, orderly, non-smoking, and averse to casual relationships, Claire is the exact opposite. Yet as the story progresses, the two find themselves inexplicably drawn to each other.\nIn the past few years, a number of films portraying the gay community and culture in a positive light have come out (the most controversial of which has to be Gregg Araki\&#39;s THE LIVING END). Most of these, however, have explored male relationships. CLAIRE OF THE MOON is one of the few movies to cross over and present the issues from the female perspective.\nThe film has its interesting points, but almost all are realized on an intellectual and not an emotional level. There\&#39;s a great deal of academic discussion on the differences between heterosexual and homosexual relationships, the nature of intimacy, and why there is so much difficulty communicating in modern society. While the viewer may not always agree with the conclusions of the characters, it\&#39;s impossible to deny that the reasoning is well thought-out and the topics are certainly worth investigation.\nThere\&#39;s another interesting feature about CLAIRE OF THE MOON that may make some male viewers squirm a little. Men are not treated particularly well in this film, and writer/director Nicole Conn makes no apologies for this. They are portrayed as little more than sex objects--bodies to satiate Claire\&#39;s hunger. Turnabout, after all, is fair play. How many times have women fit this role in male-oriented movies?\nCLAIRE OF THE MOON ultimately fails because it does a poor job of entertaining. While the film undoubtedly attempts to pique the intellect, it is, above all else, a love story and, as such, should rouse the emotions as well. For a number of reasons, it proves entirely unable to do so.\nFirst and foremost is the amateurish quality of the screenplay. The basic story is old, formula-riddled, and predictable (the only difference being that the lovers are two women rather than a man and a women). On top of that, the dialogue is unbelievably stilted. People talk like they\&#39;re reading from an intellectual treatise. I know a lot of people with excellent vocabularies and they don\&#39;t talk anything like the characters in CLAIRE OF THE MOON.\nThe acting isn\&#39;t going to win any awards either. At their best moments, the principles are merely adequate. Their characters lack depth, more often acting as mouthpieces for a philosophy than as the unique people they\&#39;re supposed to be. Worse still are the five or six supporting performers who consistently go annoyingly over-the-top. One character in particular (Caren Graham\&#39;s Tara O\&#39;Hara) is so awful--a walking cliche with a terrible Southern accent--that the film is painful to watch when she\&#39;s on-screen.\nFinally, the Nicole Conn\&#39;s direction isn\&#39;t much better than her writing. She has a lot of mellow scenery shots with Claire in reflective poses that look like they belong on the cover of romance novels. Accompanied by a &#34;dreamy&#34; score, these moments are almost comically absurd. Then there are the two fantasy sequences, which look and sound like poorly-conceived music videos.\nThere can\&#39;t be many copies of this film, because the one that I saw (on the second day of release) was not in good condition, an indication that the print has been shipped from city-to-city. Other copies across the country (however many there are) aren\&#39;t likely to be in better condition. This is a minor quibble, but it is noticeable, especially at the beginning.\nWhile it\&#39;s possible to applaud the motives of CLAIRE OF THE MOON, as well as its message, the project is simply not a strong enough movie to recommend. This is a good example of a small, independent film that boasts neither high production values nor good acting. It is a single-issue picture that\&#39;s too flawed to be given the serious attention the subject warrants.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper, Lolita Davidovich, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya Director: James B. Harris Producers: Marc Frydman and Leonardo De La Fuente Screenplay: James B. Harris based on the novel MONEY MEN by Gerald Petievich Music: Cory Lerios and John D\&#39;Andrea Released by Warner Brothers\nJimmy (Wesley Snipes) is a Federal Agent who doesn\&#39;t always play things by the book. When a bust goes bad and one of his colleagues is killed as a result, the department decides to ship him off to Newark, New Jersey. He has seven days to avenge the dead officer and find the men responsible for his death. The killer, a man named Ronnie (Viggo Mortensen) is actually the flunkey of Red (Dennis Hopper). Red has Ronnie believing that he\&#39;s a big-time crook while, in reality, he\&#39;s no more than a two-bit con artist. Together, the two start on a rarely-successful crime spree with Jimmy in hot pursuit.\nBOILING POINT is basically an average police thriller (although, surprisingly, there are no high-speed car chases) with little that\&#39;s new or original to offer to its audience. It tries to be more intelligent than most movies of the genre, but what passes for a &#34;higher quality&#34; script is just a story that\&#39;s a little less exciting. One of BOILING POINT\&#39;s main problems is that there isn\&#39;t a great deal of action and the ending is never in doubt. The few clever plot twists (none of which are substantial) don\&#39;t make up for general lack of energy evident throughout most of the movie. I doubt action fans will enjoy this film much, and those looking for a dramatic picture will be put off by the stock characters and predictable situations.\nThere are a few characters that seem completely irrelevant to the overall plot. Many of these are in supporting roles, but one main character, Lolita Davidovich\&#39;s Vikki, serves no purpose other than to provide a few moments of subtle irony and an opportunity to see other facets of the personalities of Jimmy and Red. Unfortunately, these &#34;character-building&#34; moments don\&#39;t work well. In fact, in a movie with so many scenes designed to show the human sides of both heros and villains, it\&#39;s surprising that no one attains any great depth.\nUnlike many films that focus on con artists and their scams, BOILING POINT only presents a few run-of-the mill capers. We keep expecting Red to come up with something brilliant, but the &#34;card up his sleeve&#34; is one that we learn about early--that he\&#39;s leading Ronnie on while training him to be his assassin. For his part, Red detests killing. He doesn\&#39;t even like carrying a gun.\nBOILING POINT is based on the novel MONEY MEN, which in turn is based on a true story. While this naturally limits the scope of the plot, the manner in which the story has been converted to the screen lacks style. It appears that an attempt was made to correct matters in the editing room (even a casual look reveals that the movie has been heavily edited), but there\&#39;s only so much that can be done in post-production.\nSimply put, BOILING POINT is an unspectacular movie that will vanish as quickly from theaters as it will from the memories of those who see it. It\&#39;s as mediocre a movie as there ever has been, with very little to like or despise. It certainly isn\&#39;t the best work done by either Wesley Snipes or Dennis Hopper, but neither of them need hang their heads in shame because of it. At least they got a paycheck.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a young woman inflicted with a mental illness that occasionally causes bouts of strange and manic behavior. Because of this condition, she cannot be left alone, so her brother Benny (Aidan Quinn), with whom she lives, hires a housekeeper to look after her while he works. However, Joon\&#39;s tendencies drive away woman after woman in rapid succession until there is no one left. Enter Sam (Johnny Depp), an illiterate dreamer with an irrational love of movies. He proves not only to be excellent at doing housework, but a perfect companion for Joon. Until the two of them fall in love, that is.\nBeyond recognizing that it\&#39;s a romance, it\&#39;s difficult to identify exactly what BENNY &amp; JOON is supposed to be since it is liberally sprinkled with elements of fantasy, drama, and comedy. However, no matter which of those three categories the production team was aiming for, they missed the mark. In this case, the reason why is clear.\nWhile writer Barry Berman infused his script with some clever plot elements, a few of which go contrary to the expected norms, he lost sight of two of the three principal characters in the process. Time was obviously spent sketching outlines of Sam, Joon, and Benny, but when it came to putting flesh on the bones, only Benny is given his due. Apparently, the assumption that Joon and Sam were off-the-wall was enough for the writer and director. Nothing more was necessary - show them as unusual and the audience will accept them. For Benny, a &#34;regular&#34; human being, effort had to be put into giving him substance lest the viewers identify him as one-dimensional.\nThe success or failure of a picture like BENNY &amp; JOON relies heavily upon the audience\&#39;s acceptance of the various relationships. A lack of strong, believable characters undermines the entire story. I never developed a feel or empathy for the coupling of Sam and Joon and, by the end, I didn\&#39;t care whether they got together or not.\nA little whimsy doesn\&#39;t make a story original, and it certainly doesn\&#39;t replace solid characterization. BENNY &amp; JOON\&#39;s selling point is that it\&#39;s a &#34;romance on the brink of reality.&#34; However, the actual movie isn\&#39;t nearly as fantastic as the previews lead you to believe. Aside from some quirks in Sam and Joon\&#39;s personalities, and few unusual scenes, BENNY &amp; JOON is pretty much on the straight and narrow.\nThe actors, saddled by a marginal script and uninspired direction (the camera angles and lighting in this film are awful), do the best they can with the roles. In the case of Joon, Mary Stuart Masterson gives a sub-par performance, but this is more likely the result of what she had to work with than the effort she put into the part. Whatever the case, Joon turns out to be unimpressive and too often fades into the background. Johnny Depp\&#39;s Sam fares little better--with one highly visible exception. Depp\&#39;s performances in several scenes of Chaplinesque physical comedy are standouts. Aidan Quinn, playing the &#34;straight man&#34; does a credible job--so credible, in fact, that he upstages his co-stars, which was obviously not the intent of the story.\nFor the most part, technical details in movies should be invisible to the audience. Often, when something stands out, that\&#39;s because it\&#39;s done poorly. Aside from the aforementioned problems with lighting and camerawork, the editing was ill-considered, resulting in an unevenly-paced, disjointed final product. Also, the soundtrack is banal (perhaps the only tune of interest is Joe Cocker covering the Steve Winwood/Blind Faith tune &#34;I Can\&#39;t Find My Way Home&#34;).\nIn general, I try to go into a film with as few preconceptions as I can manage, but I have to admit initially looking forward to BENNY &amp; JOON. Needless to say, it came far below the quality level I had hoped for. This is yet another case of a movie preview being superior to the film it represents. BENNY &amp; JOON is too dark to be a good comedy, too shallow to be a good drama, and too &#34;real&#34; to be a good fantasy. As a result, it\&#39;s certainly not a sterling example of American cinema.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Lou Diamond Phillips, Jennifer Tilly, Toshiro Mifune, Donald Sutherland Director: Jacques Dorfmann Producer: Claude Leger Story: David Milhaud and Jacques Dorfmann Music: Maurice Jaffey Released by Triumph Release Corporation\nAgaguk (Lou Diamond Phillips) is a young Eskimo living as a member of the tribe of his father Croomak (Toshiro Mifune), the shaman. Agaguk is impulsive and when he declares that Igiyook (Jennifer Tilly), a woman Croomak has already chosen for his own, is to be his mate, his father exiles him from the tribe. On his way out, Agaguk attempts to retrieve a stolen polar bear pelt from a white fur trapper. A struggle ensues and the trapper is killed. Along with Igiyook, Agaguk flees Croomak\&#39;s tribe. It isn\&#39;t long before the police, in the person of Henderson (Donald Sutherland) come to investigate the murder, and eventually the clues point in the direction of the exiled son of the shaman.\nI think perhaps the intention of SHADOW OF THE WOLF is to do for Eskimos what DANCES WITH WOLVES did for American Indians. If that\&#39;s the goal of the film, it isn\&#39;t achieved. In fact, regardless of the purpose of the movie, it\&#39;s a failure. The only thing worthwhile in SHADOW OF THE WOLF is its cinematography, and even that isn\&#39;t tremendously inventive or brilliant, merely effective.\nThe story is the movie\&#39;s biggest weakness. It\&#39;s convoluted, riddled with silly mystical aspects that destroy any hope of realism, and ultimately pointless. Many things happen that lead nowhere. It\&#39;s as if the people behind the film had a beginning and an ending, but needed an hour of filler to pad out the middle. Better than half of this movie--including everything involving Henderson--could have been snipped without significant loss.\nThe dialogue is absurd. Most of the characters talk in grunts, monosyllables, words, and occasionally short sentences. Actually, they generally bellow and shout more than talk. Lou Diamond Phillips probably goes for nearly forty-five minutes before he has more than a couple of lines to say. Jennifer Tilly never says much of substance, which is probably good, considering the audience\&#39;s tendency to laugh every time she said something in that high-pitched, squeaky voice of hers.\nJust about everyone, except perhaps Donald Sutherland as a Canadian police officer, is miscast. Lou Diamond Phillips shows little charisma and less ability trying to portray the rebellious Agaguk. Toshiro Mifune, a fine Japanese actor, is wasted, as well as embarrassed, in his role. And it\&#39;s impossible to understand where the production team came up with Jennifer Tilly for the female lead. Not only is her acting ability severely limited, but she looks nothing like an Eskimo.\nThe musical score is intrusive and melodramatic. At moments of high tension, it becomes strident, much like that of a soap opera. The overall sound quality is dubious. There are some scenes where dialogue dubbed in later isn\&#39;t perfectly synched with the moving lips of the person or persons speaking (or chanting) it.\nThere are a few worthwhile moments in SHADOW OF THE WOLF, although not nearly enough to justify sitting through it. The igloo-building is fascinating, as is the whale-hunting expedition, and the trek to the &#34;Top of the World.&#34; Other than that, however, everything is either overdone, underdone, or done so poorly as to not be worth watching. SHADOW OF THE WOLF has lofty ambitions--to be a saga centered around Canadian Eskimos--none of which are achieved.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Date Released: 5/7/93 Running Length: 2:00 Rated: PG-13 (Violence, sex, language)\nStarring: Jason Scott Lee, Lauren Holly, Robert Wagner, Michael Learned Director: Rob Cohen Producer: Raffella de Laurentiis Screenplay: Edward Khmara, John Raffo, and Rob Cohen Music: Randy Edelman Released by Universal Pictures\nDRAGON is less a strict recounting of the life of Bruce Lee (played by Jason Scott Lee--no relation) than it is a tribute to him. Based on the book BRUCE LEE, THE MAN ONLY I KNEW by Linda Lee, this film tells the story of an icon. Since Bruce is regarded as a hero by this picture, how much we actually get to learn about him is uncertain. At any rate, the film follows his life quickly through childhood, then begins a more detailed account of events as Bruce heads for America. DRAGON ends shortly before the title character&#39;s death, leaving one of the most talked-about aspect of his existence unexplored. Perhaps it&#39;s better that way.\nThere&#39;s no doubt that, even more than Danny DeVito&#39;s HOFFA, this picture was devised to show Bruce Lee in the most positive light possible. He is larger than life throughout the film, whether he is fighting human foes or the demon that stalks his nightmares. DRAGON captures the energy and exuberance of Bruce Lee, but it fails to give more than an incomplete picture of the man behind the personae. In that way, it is unlike HOFFA, CHAPLIN, or MALCOLM X, three other recent, high-profile screen biographies that attempt to present a more balanced portrait.\nThe Kung Fu fights, well-choreographed and obviously overdone, are executed in the same unforgettable way that similar scenes were done in Lee&#39;s own movies. In addition to being a homage to the late actor, they&#39;re fun to watch, and add an element of action to what otherwise would have been straight melodrama.\nDramatically, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of substance to DRAGON. It isn&#39;t going to make anyone cry with its power of human insight. There are some nice scenes--especially those early in the relationship of Bruce and Linda (Lauren Holly). Also present is a subtle-but-forceful point about racism in 1960s Hollywood (as Lee is refused the chance to play the lead character in the series KUNG FU, which he helped develop).\nJason Scott Lee is a good choice to play Lee. The physical resemblance may not be perfect, but Jason matches Bruce for energy and screen presence. His acting is not superior--there are two scenes (one in the hospital after Bruce is seriously injured in a fight and another in Hong Kong when his wife tells him she&#39;s taking the children back to America) that are horribly overacted--but Jason has charisma and that covers for a great many faults.\nAn eerie dimension has been added to this picture by the tragic March death of Brandon Lee, Bruce&#39;s only son. It shifts the focus of Bruce&#39;s climactic battle with the demon, in which he fights to save not himself, but his son. An unexpected level of poignancy has been added to this--and other--scenes by a cruel twist of fate that the producers could not have foreseen. The movie is dedicated to Brandon.\nDRAGON is a fun experience, but far from a great film, and those expecting a probing examination of Bruce Lee&#39;s life are likely to be disappointed. Still, as a celebration of the first international Chinese-American movie star, the movie keeps the audience interested and entertained for its full running time, which is not an insignificant feat.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Date Released: 5/7/93 Running Length: 1:40 Rated: NC-17 (Sex, nudity)\nStarring: Karina Lombard, Nathaniel Parker, Claudia Robinson, Rachel Ward, Michael York Director: John Duigan Producer: Sara Risher Screenplay: Jan Sharp, Carole Angier, and John Duigan from the book by Jean Rhys Music: Stewart Copeland Released by Fine Line Features\nThe story of WIDE SARGASSO SEA is a prequel to Charlotte Bronte&#39;s classic JANE EYRE. It tells what happened before the events of that novel, explaining in some detail the history behind the mad West Indian wife that Rochester (Nathaniel Parker) keeps locked away in the attic. When Rochester is first introduced, he is a fortune hunter, and Antoinette Cosway (Karina Lombard) is the object of his attention. She has a sizeable land holding in Jamaica that he wants to make his own, so he entices her into marrying him. For a while, the couple seems genuinely happy, but eventually an ugly secret from Antoinette&#39;s past--one that may also foretell her future doom--comes to light.\nWIDE SARGASSO SEA, faithful to the novel from which its story is taken, is a beautifully photographed, wonderfully sensual, and poorly-paced motion picture. The first half-hour moves along nicely, but then the film bogs down and by the last fifteen minutes (which go by in blur), WIDE SARGASSO SEA has become virtually stagnant.\nDirector John Duigan knows what he&#39;s doing when it comes to using a setting to convey feelings. WIDE SARGASSO SEA is a vibrant movie, one of images and passions. His sweltering 1840s Jamaica is perfectly rendered as the backdrop for the tumultuous relationship between Antoinette and Rochester. Duigan manages something difficult--getting an audience sitting in a cool movie theater to feel like they&#39;re in the tropics. Equal credit must go to cinematographer Geoff Burton, who displays talent for the visuals of this film.\nEven with its uneven tone, WIDE SARGASSO SEA might have been a success had stronger performers been hired in the leading roles. While both Karina Lombard and Nathaniel Parker are pleasing to look at, neither is capable of delivering dialogue with any consistent degree of realism. With the characters not being realized with full power, the storyline becomes plodding, and the movie threatens to grind to a halt.\nAs a romance, this movie is mildly successful. As a tragedy, it isn&#39;t nearly as good. The fatal wedge in the marriage (the likelihood that Antoinette will eventually become as insane as her mother) seems overplayed. One must remember that this is not a a contemporary society and insanity was thought of much differently, but the film has trouble presenting solid character motivation during its second half. The relationship between Antoinette and Rochester, which was developed with great skill, is torn down with far less concern for detail.\nThere are a lot of sex scenes in this film, but nothing to earn it an NC-17. BASIC INSTINCT was as explicit, and perhaps THE LOVER even more so--with one caveat. There is a shot of full-frontal male nudity in WIDE SARGASSO SEA. That apparently is a no-no for a movie wanting an R. As a result, this film gets the dreaded NC-17.\nWIDE SARGASSO SEA is has a strong beginning. By the time the pacing becomes a problem, the viewer is engrossed enough that he or she is unwilling to let go just because the story is moving slowly. It isn&#39;t that this is a bad movie, because it&#39;s not. Rather, it&#39;s a question of how powerful it could have been with lead performers who could bolster--rather than mute--the strength of the main characters, because the interest in Antoinette and Rochester is exclusively what pulls the audience through the flatter parts of the story.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Date Released: 5/14/93 Running Length: 1:53 Rated: PG (Mature themes)\nStarring: Richard Dreyfus, Mercedes Ruehl, Irene Worth, Brad Stoll, Mike Damus Director: Martha Coolidge Producer: Ray Stark Screenplay: Neil Simon (based on his play) Music: Elmer Bernstein Released by Columbia Pictures\nIt\&#39;s the early 1940s in New York and the country is at war. When the father of young Jay (Brad Stoll) and Arty (Mike Damus) has to go on a prolonged business trip through the southern states (he fell heavily in debt paying his dying wife\&#39;s hospital bills and now he has to find a way to make enough money to keep the loan sharks from killing him), he leaves his sons with his mother (Irene Worth), who owns a candy store in Yonkers. Grandma is a cold, cruel person who believes that boys should not cry and metes out punishment with an iron fist, and both of her grandsons quickly learn to fear and hate her. Also living in the house is Bella (Mercedes Ruehl), the boys\&#39; childlike, wacky aunt who wants nothing more than to have someone to hold and love. Stopping in for a few days is Bella\&#39;s gangster brother, Louie (Richard Dreyfus), a small-time operator who teaches his nephews a few lessons about life.\nAs is often true of stories penned by play-and-screenwriter Neil Simon, this is a simple tale about simple people. No momentous or earth-shattering events take place, and there\&#39;s nothing that one would normally believe worth making a movie about. In fact, for about the first third of the film, it looks like the decision to finance this project was a mistake. Except for a few humorous vignettes, this part of LOST IN YONKERS is dull and unspectacular.\nRichard Dreyfus has top billing, but he\&#39;s not in much of the movie. Nevertheless, despite limited screen time, Dreyfus\&#39; Louie is a pivotal character, giving impetus to the story. LOST IN YONKERS is almost half over by the time Louie makes his first appearance and he\&#39;s gone before the final quarter. Yet the character, fleshed out by a powerful performance, is the center-point of the picture, a marvelous mix of anger, greed, and likableness.\nMercedes Ruehl\&#39;s performance, like the development of her character, goes through a transition as the film progresses. Near the beginning of LOST IN YONKERS, Bella is completely unconvincing, presenting a wide-eyed facade of sheer idiocy that few viewers are likely to accept. It doesn\&#39;t help that Ms. Ruehl goes over-the-top during these scenes. However, as the film moves forward, not only does Bella become more believable, but the actress finds her rhythm. It can be argued that the transition of the character is difficult to swallow, and while that may be true, I find the problem more to be where Bella starts, not where she ends up.\nAlthough Simon has set this story in the 40s, LOST IN YONKERS is a rare example of a period piece that doesn\&#39;t strive for nostalgia. The costumes and settings are right, but the script isn\&#39;t laden with the too-common sense of longing that makes the audience look back fondly on days gone by.\nThe pacing of LOST IN YONKERS is off. The first half of the movie is relatively light, with frequent bursts of humor. Later, however, the movie becomes an emotional experience, with almost too many intense scenes. The two children, who are clearly at the forefront during the movie\&#39;s first hour, get lost for a while as the conflict between Bella and her mother is highlighted.\nThe story of LOST IN YONKERS is mostly solid and doesn\&#39;t suffer from the &#34;everything must be happy&#34; Hollywood-type ending, but the uneven tone hurts the screen adaptation of Simon\&#39;s Pulitzer-Prize-winning play. Something has definitely been lost in the translation, and as hard as the movie works to keep its audience\&#39;s attention, it\&#39;s only partially successful. Dreyfus is magnetic, but this is really Mercedes Ruehl\&#39;s movie, and she\&#39;s only occasionally up to the job.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Date Released: 6/18/93 Running Length: 1:53 Rated: PG-13 (Mature themes, language)\nStarring: Kathleen Turner, Tommy Lee Jones, Asha Menina, Park Overall Director: Michael Lessac Producers: Dale Pollock, L. Holfong, and Wolfgang Glattis Screenplay: Michael Lessac Music: James Horner Released by Penta Pictures\nWhile in Mexico, Ruth (Kathleen Turner) and her family suffer a devastating loss when her husband Alex is killed in an accident. Some time later, after being away for years, they return to their North Carolina home with the hope of starting anew. Shortly after coming back and for no apparent reason, Ruth&#39;s six-year old daughter Sally (Asha Menina) withdraws from reality. Although fluent in three languages, Sally refuses to speak in any of them, nor will she acknowledge the presence of her mother. However, she develops an affinity for high places and after she nearly kills herself climbing in a building construction site, the court places her in the custody of Dr. Jacob Beerlander (Tommy Lee Jones), a psychiatrist who&#39;s an expert in dealing with dissociated children.\nI have the feeling that people will either love or hate this movie. Its success depends entirely upon the emotional reaction of the audience. It delivers a powerful punch, but the logic of the plot is uncertain and there are a lot (too many for my taste) of things left unexplained. Writer/director Michael Lessac has taken a few liberties with reality, occasionally stretching things beyond the bounds of credibility.\nI&#39;ll admit to being touched by HOUSE OF CARDS, but even as the movie worked its skillful manipulation on my emotions, it confounded my intelligence with a storyline that doesn&#39;t seem well thought out. It&#39;s difficult to talk about specifics without giving things away, but suffice it to say that every time the movie got me completely immersed in its peculiar brand of magic, the script did something inconceivable that left me feeling unsatisfied.\nThe acting in HOUSE OF CARDS ranges from passable to excellent. Kathleen Turner is good as the widowed Ruth. The character is occasionally difficult to watch, but that&#39;s more because of the emotions churning within Ruth than because of a flaw in Ms. Turner&#39;s performance. Tommy Lee Jones is perhaps too restrained as Jacob Beerlander, and certainly never sympathetic. Asha Menina, on the other hand, gives a memorable performance, clearly outacting all the adults.\nOne of the most interesting--and believable--scenes in this film occurs in Dr. Beerlander&#39;s school for children as kids with various problems are introduced to Ruth. Unlike much of the rest of the film, this part is not manipulative, but is nevertheless moving, principally because it seems so real.\nThe greatest fault with HOUSE OF CARDS is that too little of it is believable. In attempting to play on the audience&#39;s emotions as well as create an almost-mystical atmosphere, this movie has allowed too many difficult-to-accept contrivances seep into the plot. Given the potential power of the script, this annoyed me, in addition to presenting an unwanted distraction. I wish I could give a wholehearted recommendation, but the best I can do is give one with qualifications. Undoubtedly, there is an audience for this film, but I think it&#39;s a small one.\nI&#39;ll reiterate what I said at the beginning of this review. Most viewers will probably either love the film or hate it. Those that can completely suspend their disbelief and allow the emotional tide of HOUSE OF CARDS to carry them away (as it did in Houston, where this movie won top honors at that city&#39;s film festival), will love this picture. Everyone else will find it slow-moving and hard to accept. Oddly enough, I find myself somewhere in the middle, having found some enjoyment in HOUSE OF CARDS, but wishing for a lot more.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Starring: Thomas Ian Griffith, Lance Henriksen, James Earl Jones, Charlotte Lewis, Tony Todd Director: Jon Hess Producers: Thomas Ian Griffith and Erwin Stoff Screenplay: Thomas Ian Griffith Music: Charles Bernstein Released by New Line Cinema\nTerry McCain (Thomas Ian Griffith) is a cop who doesn\&#39;t mind using excessive force to get his man, and when two police friends are killed in a dispute with a drug kingpin (Burt Young), McCain will stop at nothing to get his revenge. Soon, however, it becomes apparent that someone on the force is in league with the criminals, and that the lives of both McCain and his girlfriend Anna (Charlotte Lewis) are in danger.\nA detailed review of EXCESSIVE FORCE seems unnecessary. This film is made for a specific audience. Those who like these kinds of movies--festivals of mindless violence--will see Thomas Ian Griffith\&#39;s film, while those who aren\&#39;t fond of the genre will stay away. Little that I say here is likely to make any difference to anyone, but since I sat through this ninety- minute travesty, I intend to express my opinion.\nAs is usually the case with low-budget action films, the plot is virtually nonexistent--a nonsensical affectation upon which the scenes of kick-boxing and shooting can be hung. For EXCESSIVE FORCE, no attempt is made to simulate reality in the story. There is no possible way that any genuine police department could be run with this degree of ineptitude and corruption.\nThere\&#39;s plenty of action and blood, but not much excitement. Good films of this genre are rousing. This one is simply dull. Never do we believe that the hero is in any danger. This creates a sense of inevitability, draining most of the fight sequences of vital energy.\nThomas Ian Griffith, despite bulging biceps and an impressive physique, has little to boast about. His acting isn\&#39;t any better than Steven Seagal\&#39;s and he lacks anything resembling charisma. Frankly, I didn\&#39;t care what happened to his character, as long as it happened quickly so I could get out of the theater. Someone is trying to make Griffith into the next martial arts star, but I don\&#39;t buy it.\nJames Earl Jones makes a few appearances as Jake, the owner of the bar above which McCain lives. This role is superfluous and obviously included in an attempt to give EXCESSIVE FORCE credibility through the use of a &#34;big name&#34;. It doesn\&#39;t work. Fortunately, Jones\&#39; reputation is solid enough that this shouldn\&#39;t blemish it. I hope he got paid well.\nIn the past, I have been known (upon occasion) to enjoy mindless action films. EXCESSIVE FORCE doesn\&#39;t fall into that group. Simply put, this is a bad movie and should be treated as such by anyone considering viewing it, whether they enjoy the genre or not. It\&#39;s a decidedly unpleasant experience.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Date Released: 5/14/93 Running Length: 1:51 Rated: R (Violence, language, sex, nudity)\nStarring: Mario Van Peebles, Stephen Baldwin, Billy Zane, Charles Lane, Big Daddy Kane, Salli Richardson Director: Mario Van Peebles Producers: Preston Holmes and Jim Steele Screenplay: Sy Richardson and Dario Scardapane Music: Michel Colombier Released by Gramercy Pictures\nThe posse of Jessie Lee (Mario Van Peebles) is assembled in Cuba when a small group of dissenters escape from an ambush set by the sadistic Colonel Graham (Billy Zane). From Cuba of 1896 to the U.S., Lee&#39;s posse moves west as he pursues vengeance against the men who murdered his father. With Colonel Graham hot on his heels, Lee arrives in Freemanville (a community of ex-slaves), the culmination of his father&#39;s dreams and a place in danger from a group of corrupt whites from the next town over.\nIn constructing POSSE, Van Peebles has put together something of a traditional western with a twist: with the exception of Baldwin&#39;s Little J, the members of the group are black. Some interesting race-related points are raised, but Van Peebles disappoints by focusing instead on the standard elements of the picture. By the film&#39;s end, this has degenerated into little more than a 19th-Century shoot-em-up. POSSE is a violent movie, but without the grittiness that characterized Clint Eastwood&#39;s Academy Award winning UNFORGIVEN.\nTechnically, this film is a mess. Considering how well NEW JACK CITY (Van Peebles&#39; previous effort) fared in this arena, that&#39;s something of a surprise. However, in POSSE, the editing is sub-par--scenes often come to jarring conclusions. The music at times seems better-suited to a contemporary action film than a western, and the quick changing of camera angles occasionally makes POSSE feel like something created for MTV.\nDespite numerous problems, POSSE remains an entertaining film. In addition to bringing a refreshingly new perspective to the western, it tells a solid story. The subplot involving Graham perhaps creates some unnecessary baggage, but the main conflict between Van Peebles and Richard Jordan in Freemanville is well-developed. We are also given a rare (for movies) glimpse into the interrelationship between Native Americans and African Americans.\nA comparison to GLORY is worth making. In many ways, the intentions of the two films are similar--both attempt to redress the historical inaccuracies of Hollywood. However, where GLORY succeeds brilliantly by wedding the dramatic impact of the black man&#39;s role in the Civil War with its overall tale, POSSE fails to attain the same level. With only a few minor script alterations and some re-casting, this could easily have been an all-white film. Many of the most important and intriguing questions about the real roles of blacks in the Old West are sadly left unexplored. POSSE serves merely to whet our appetites.\nEven considering the limited success of the attempt, it&#39;s important that the effort was made, if for no other reason than that to open a few eyes and make some people aware of the bias of a white-written American history. POSSE also has enough entertainment value to make it worth a look, especially for those who enjoy westerns. It certainly isn&#39;t a definitive film, but it has its high points.\n&#34;,
 &#34;On the rebound from a lifeless seven-year marriage and trying to get her personal life back on track, Carly Norris (Sharon Stone) decides for a change in venue and opts to move into an upscale Manhattan high-rise. There she meets a trio of unusual neighbors. There&#39;s Vida (Polly Walker), the girl across the hall, who likes cocaine and knows a few too many secrets. Jack Landsford (Tom Berenger) is a successful author who uses every ounce of his charm to snare a date with Carly. Zeke Hawkins (William Baldwin) seems normal at first, but it doesn&#39;t take Carly long to figure out that he&#39;s hiding something. Despite the oddities of some of the building&#39;s other tenants, Carly comfortably settles into her new home while someone watches her on a bank of video screens that show every room in every apartment of the Sliver building.\nAs many studies indicate, voyeurism is one of America&#39;s secret pastimes. It doesn&#39;t have to be peeping through a bedroom window or watching a couple making love through a telescope. The seductive power of voyeurism is the knowledge that you&#39;re watching something real--not acted or scripted--and the players in the drama have no idea they&#39;re under scrutiny. It&#39;s addictive, and those hooked on it can become more involved in living the lives of others than their own.\nIra Levin&#39;s novel SLIVER explores the dangerous obsession that can come about as a result of continuous voyeurism. While the book is not a psychological or artistic milestone, it makes for compulsive page-turning. The story is entertaining and focused (until the end), and the characters seem real. In the decisions made to turn the novel into a movie, all of that was lost.\nIn the movie, voyeurism is a plot device in a script that goes nowhere and whose effete and implausible resolution leaves 50% of the audience&#39;s questions unanswered. If we really cared about the movie or its poorly developed characters, this might be a blow, but SLIVER is so badly put together that its abrupt conclusion is likely to provoke little response.\nPersonally, I don&#39;t have a problem with a movie changing the story of the book from which it has been adapted, as long as the changes are sensible and effective. SLIVER, which rips apart the foundation of Ira Levin&#39;s novel (going so far as to change the identity of the killer), is a butcher&#39;s job--a hodgepodge of stuff from the book and Joe Eszterhas&#39; pen. The strengths of the original story are muted and the weaknesses magnified. The ending is nowhere to be found, and what appears in the movie is so disjointed and contradictory that it leaves the viewer feeling cold and cheated.\nBecause of writer Eszterhas and actress Stone, comparisons with BASIC INSTINCT are unavoidable. Actually, any similarities are superficial. There&#39;s a lot of nudity (but no icepicks) and a few deaths but, aside from Eszterhas&#39; often-embarrassing dialogue, the two films aren&#39;t that close.\nAs if it isn&#39;t bad enough that the script needs a major re-write, this lackluster production suffers from other problems. None of the three major players are in top form. Sharon Stone, who was effective as the femme fatale of BASIC INSTINCT, shows a lack of aptitude in playing the woman-in-distress. Her emotional range in SLIVER is limited and she fails to generate much sympathy. William Baldwin&#39;s portrayal is too bland for a character with the depth of passion and emotion that Zeke is supposed to have. Tom Berenger puts a great deal of energy into what is essentially a thankless role (his character isn&#39;t in the book), but little that we see or learn about Jack Landsford makes much sense. The gem in the rough of SLIVER is Polly Walker (the spoiled heiress of ENCHANTED APRIL, who Phillip Noyce also directed in PATRIOT GAMES), although she&#39;s on-screen for too few scenes.\nProduction-wise, SLIVER has the look and feel of something from MTV. The incidental music is intrusive and the quick-cuts are distracting. With the movie&#39;s focus on video, it&#39;s odd that the visuals are so pedestrian. There is also a sense of heavy editing. At least one scene referred to explicitly has been cut out.\nWith thrillers, it&#39;s difficult to say who will like what. Certainly, those who are looking for a good whodunnit won&#39;t find it in SLIVER. Equally displeased with this film will be the moviegoer looking for a fast-paced film. Even those who loved BASIC INSTINCT may be disappointed--SLIVER has little of the tension and relentless energy that marked Verhoeven&#39;s 1992 movie. All-in-all, there&#39;s little here to please anyone, and those who loved Levin&#39;s book are bound to leave the theater disgusted.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Date Released: 5/7/93 (limited distribution) Running Length: 1:51 Rated: PG-13 (Mature themes, nudity)\nStarring: Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Robert Sean Leonard, Kate Beckinsale, Keanu Reeves, Richard Briers, Michael Keaton, Brian Blessed Director: Kenneth Branagh Producers: Kenneth Branagh, David Parfitt, and Stephen Evans Screenplay: Kenneth Branagh based on the play by William Shakespeare Music: Patrick Doyle Released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is Kenneth Branagh&#39;s adaptation of one of Shakespeare&#39;s better-known comedies. Centered around two romances--Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), and Benedick (Kenneth Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson)--the story follows these very different courtships. For Hero and Claudio, it&#39;s love at first sight and, as with any immediate attraction, they have a lot to learn about each other. Beatrice and Benedick, on the other hand, have known each other for quite some time and it takes a little none-too-subtle prodding from their friends to help them realize and admit their feelings.\nWith HENRY V, Kenneth Branagh made a stunning motion picture directorial debut, setting the cinematic world on its collective ear with a rendering of the story that many considered the equal of, if not superior to, the legendary Laurence Olivier production. Now, two films (DEAD AGAIN and PETER&#39;S FRIENDS) and four years later, Branagh has again taken Shakespeare to his pinnacle. If anything, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is better than HENRY V. If Branagh&#39;s place as one of today&#39;s standout directors has not been assured before now, this will surely clinch the position for him.\nFor those who don&#39;t find Shakespeare&#39;s comedies funny (and it can be something of a stretch to laugh when reading the lines in a book), this is the film to see. Simply put, the movie is hilarious. It isn&#39;t just the lines that create laughter, but the way Branagh has set them up and the manner in which the actors deliver them. Expressions and actions often play a large part in the comedy, some of which is decidedly physical. These are the kinds of things that don&#39;t appear on the written page.\nThere&#39;s also a fair amount of drama in the film as well, and the performers and director do as well with the serious stuff as they do with the lighter material. Pathos and poignancy come as easily and naturally as humor. Emotions run high in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and cover the spectrum from one end to the other. Fortunately, everyone involved is capable of upholding the pacing and tone that the film demands to be successful.\nThe life and vitality of this production are amazing. Things move along with a breezy energy that makes it impossible not to get caught up in the experience. I defy anyone, no matter how boring they find the written Shakespeare, to fall asleep during this celebration. Even if everything else was low-key (which it definitely isn&#39;t), Patrick Doyle&#39;s rousing score alone would be enough to keep many people&#39;s attention. MUCH ADO is one of the most engaging films I&#39;ve seen in years. That I never once glanced at my watch is testimony enough of how enraptured I was.\nWhile Branagh is not entirely faithful to the original text of MUCH ADO, his film takes pains to capture the play&#39;s spirit. Certain (mostly small) elements of the source material have been excised, most of which contain obscure references and jokes that a twentieth-century audience would fail to either understand or find amusing. Only Shakespearean purists are likely to recognize the changes, however, none of which are gross enough to cause outrage to the few who notice their absence. The majority of the audience will never know what&#39;s missing, nor will they care.\nAt first glance, some of the casting choices seem odd, to say the least. Regardless of how out-of-place certain names look, however, even the least effective of the performers does a fine job. No one who appeared in MUCH ADO has anything to be ashamed of about the effort they put into the film, or the result that appears on the screen.\nAs might be expected, Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson turn out sparkling, flawless performances. Neither of them has done better work. Considering some of their past roles, that&#39;s high praise. When they are together, the chemistry is apparent. It was one of the high points of DEAD AGAIN and PETER&#39;S FRIENDS, and that&#39;s true again here. Branagh and Thompson are worthy contemporary rivals of any of the silver screen&#39;s great husband-and-wife couples.\nIt&#39;s refreshing to see Denzel Washington (as Don Pedro) playing in a comedy. This may not be his first, but it&#39;s his best. With his better-known roles coming in films like GLORY and MALCOLM X, it&#39;s good to see Washington doing something lighter. He fits in perfectly with the rest of the cast, and race is never an issue. Casting him might have been one of Branagh&#39;s more daring moves in preparing this film. Happily, it works.\nIf there was to be a poor job done, one would expect it to come from Keanu Reeves. Surprisingly perhaps, he acquits himself well in an admittedly small role (that of Don Pedro&#39;s bastard brother Don John, the villain of the story). There is fire in his eyes and his few lines are delivered with cold ruthlessness. On the other hand, Robert Sean Leonard&#39;s range is occasionally stretched, but the hiccups in his performance do nothing to damage the film.\nVeterans Richard Briers and Brian Blessed, along with newcomer Kate Beckinsale, fill out the supporting roles with typical British flair. Michael Keaton is marvellous as the over-the-top Constable Dogberry. He&#39;s like something lifted from MONTY PYTHON, complete with THE HOLY GRAIL&#39;s galloping around on a non-existent horse.\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is a gem of a movie--real find in 1993&#39;s sea of mediocrity. It&#39;s unfortunate that the film is unlikely to get a general release, but if the nearest theater showing it is a little further away than you normally travel, it&#39;s worth the trip. Easily the best film of the year to date, Kenneth Branagh&#39;s MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is also one of the most entertaining and scintillating motion pictures to grace the screen in the past decade.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Starring: Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Paul Winfield Director: Renny Harlin Producer: Alan Marshall and Renny Harlin Screenplay: Michael France and Sylvester Stallone Music: Trevor Jones Released by Carolco through TriStar Pictures\nGabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is a member of a mountain climbing rescue team. When one of his operations goes wrong and the girlfriend of his best friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) is killed, Gabe blames himself and leaves. Eight months later, after setting up a life in Denver, he returns to the mountains to persuade his lover Jessie (Janine Turner) to come with him. While he\&#39;s there, a call for help comes in and Gabe decides to become involved in one last rescue attempt. However, unknown to him, the rescue call is a fake, put out by a group of hijackers stranded in the mountains after the crash of their plane. Led by the psychotic Qualen (John Lithgow), they\&#39;re after three suitcases of money ($100,000,000) that are lost somewhere in the peaks and valleys of the Colorado Rockies.\nHey, what\&#39;s a down-and-out street fighter from South Philly doing climbing mountains in a tee-shirt?\nSeriously, though, Sylvester Stallone\&#39;s newest character may be named &#34;Gabe,&#34; but he takes an awful lot from the likes of men named &#34;Rocky&#34; and &#34;Rambo.&#34; There\&#39;s also a little of John McClane in him as well. This is not an original or interesting personae, and it shows what can happen when an actor becomes too-easily identified with one (or two) roles. To his credit, Stallone tried to do something different (two terrible comedies called OSCAR and STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT), but when the &#34;great experiment&#34; failed, he returned to the genre where he made his money. Whether CLIFFHANGER will bring Stallone\&#39;s name back into the top echelon of action movie stars has yet to be determined, but if this film can\&#39;t, the task may be impossible.\nBefore I get too deeply into what inevitably will be a mostly-negative review, let me say that I enjoyed much of CLIFFHANGER on a purely mindless level. Although seriously flawed in many aspects, there\&#39;s enough action and adventure to keep just about anyone interested. CLIFFHANGER is the motion picture equivalent of a roller coaster--lots of thrills and chills without much substance, and almost immediately forgotten the moment it\&#39;s over. Unlike the roller coaster, however, this isn\&#39;t a ride you\&#39;re likely to take over and over again. Once is certainly enough.\nThe first scene typifies the entire movie. There\&#39;s a lot of action and a fair degree of tension (even though it\&#39;s pretty obvious what\&#39;s going to happen). Stallone\&#39;s muscles are shown to their best advantage as he reaches out to save the life of a girl hanging by a thread. Bad dialogue abounds, as does lame acting. &#34;Please don\&#39;t let me die!&#34; begs the girl at least half-a-dozen times before plunging to her doom. This is not an example of a well-written dramatic moment, but it\&#39;s indicative of how all of CLIFFHANGER has been put together.\nWhen the film goes for drama, it invariably fails. The dialogue is routine, frequently punctuated by cliches, and the character-building scenes do little more than waste time. One could argue that there\&#39;s not enough action in the picture because of these long, drawn-out sequences. They don\&#39;t work, so their inclusion damages CLIFFHANGER\&#39;s pace.\nThe editing is suspect. The final product appears heavily cut. Numerous transition scenes have been trimmed in favor of the above-mentioned character moments. There are also several useless scenes featuring a couple of high school kids who have no purpose whatsoever in the overall storyline. I\&#39;m sure none of the expensive shots were eliminated, but the curious choice of what to use has given CLIFFHANGER an uneven tone.\nThere are several moments of unintentional humor. Stallone\&#39;s Gabe is clearly someone with superhuman stamina. No real person could take the pounding that he does and stay alive, not to mention on his feet. This film makes DIE HARD look like a cakewalk. How many times can a person survive crashing into the side of a mountain or falling thirty feet into an ice-packed crevice? Suspension of disbelief is an issue. Some action films achieve this with little effort, but CLIFFHANGER too often struggles to entrance the audience. The fault lies mostly with the pedestrian script.\nRenny Harlin showed in DIE HARD II that he has skill when it comes to directing action sequences. This ability is evident in CLIFFHANGER. Sure, the movie borrows from other action films (most notably the original DIE HARD), but it does so in a big, bold way, and there\&#39;s enough new stuff to keep scenes fresh. Unfortunately, as strong as Harlin is with the mountains and hardware, he\&#39;s that weak with the actors. He gets little out of them, seeming more interested in the next avalanche than a reasonably delivered line.\nJohn Lithgow is surprisingly ineffective as the villain. Given his past track record, one would think he would be perfect to play the Alan Rickman clone (a smooth-talking, British-accented psychotic who\&#39;s out for the money). However, the role is woefully underplayed and Lithgow\&#39;s Qualen becomes the least-hated member of his group of thugs and mercenaries. CLIFFHANGER takes pains to make us loathe the bad guys, but it\&#39;s the ringleader that we have the least antipathy for.\nWhat more can I say about CLIFFHANGER? If you\&#39;re in the mood for something that\&#39;s completely visceral and mindless (really mindless-- the plot is a joke, filled with contrivances and coincidences), this movie will fit the bill. Parts of it are excruciatingly bad, but there are numerous examples of well-directed action that, on balance, tend to make up for the worst gaffes. This is a poor man\&#39;s DIE HARD. It has the explosions, gunplay, and spectacular stunts, but little of the wit and intelligence. In other words, it\&#39;s a typical summer action flick.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: 5/28/93 Running Length: 1:50 Rated: PG-13 (Language, mature themes, sexual situations, brief nudity)\nStarring: Whoopi Goldberg, Ted Danson, Nia Long, Will Smith, Jennifer Tilly Director: Richard Benjamin Producers: Arnon Milchan, Rick Bieber, and Michael Douglas Screenplay: Holly Goldberg Sloan Music: Mark Isham Released by Warner Brothers\nAs a result of a simple science class blood test, Zora Matthews (Nia Long) discovers that the man she had long thought of as her father couldn\&#39;t be. After confronting her mother with this disarming truth, Sarah Matthews (Whoopi Goldberg) confesses to Zora that she is a product of artificial insemination. This sparks a quest for Zora to discover her real father. After getting the information from the sperm bank\&#39;s records, she goes to meet Hal Jackson (Ted Danson), and finds out that the man whose sperm her mother used is rude, crude, and, worst of all, white.\nYeah, there are a lot of implausibilities in this script, but the story moves along snappily enough that most of them are easily overlooked. More difficult to miss is Richard Benjamin\&#39;s occasionally inadequate direction. There are numerous scenes that could have been a whole lot funnier had Benjamin been more deft in choreographing them. Too often, he is heavy-handed, but the film survives in spite of him.\nThe first half of MADE IN AMERICA is highly amusing. Comedy is divided nicely between the outrageous and the subtle (although Bejamin likes to &#34;point out&#34; the less obvious moments by using tricks such as slow-motion). Unfortunately, the comic momentum fades as the film moves to a climax, with the big &#34;plot twist&#34; near the end seeming like something out of bad television melodrama. There are a lot of different ways that the story could have gone; the route it chooses is less-than-satisfying.\nSurprisingly, although this is billed as a romantic comedy, I didn\&#39;t find the romance between Sarah and Hal of particular note. Despite the rumors linking Goldberg and Danson together off-screen, there doesn\&#39;t seem to be much chemistry between them. Far better are the interactions between mother and daughter, and father and daughter. I could believe these, which are at times touching and sweet, and on other occasions laced with bitterness.\nThere\&#39;s no question that the best performance is given by Nia Long. Goldberg and Danson don\&#39;t have to stretch much to keep in character. Hal is little more than a southern extension of CHEERS\&#39; Sam Malone and Sarah Matthews echoes roles that Goldberg has played in the past (a politically correct African-American single mother). Jennifer Tilly has a minor role as Hal\&#39;s blond, airheaded, helium-voiced girlfriend. This seems to be a part that she was born to play. Never have I been more impressed with Ms. Tilly\&#39;s acting than when she stares into the camera with that vacuous expression.\nOne of the failures of MADE IN AMERICA is in the way it introduces the two main characters. At the outset of the film, both Sarah and Hal are portrayed as irresponsible, arrogant, and thoroughly dislikeable. Although they soften as the story progresses, and the audience gradually warms to them, this is not a positive way to start a movie. It\&#39;s typical in a romantic comedy for one of the partners to be acerbic and unpleasant, but it\&#39;s unusual for this to be true of both of them. Had the comedy been less fresh, MADE IN AMERICA might have lost me early on.\nAs far as comedies go, this one is above-average, primarily because there aren\&#39;t many clunkers among its jokes. Character development is so-so, and there are number of problems, some of which are significant, about the way the story progresses during the last half-hour. Overall, however, MADE IN AMERICA is enjoyable. It handles the issue of a mixed-race relationship sensitively (instead of sensationalistically) and presents an intriguing look at a very different family dynamic.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: 5/26/93 Running Length: 1:37 Rated: R (Language, violence, sexual situations, mature themes))\nStarring: Tyrin Turner, Larenz Tate, Jada Pickett, Charles S. Dutton Directors: Allen and Albert Hughes Producer: Darin Scott Screenplay: Tyger Williams Music: QD III Released by New Line Cinema\nAs a child, Caine (Tyrin Turner) was raised in a &#34;den of thieves,&#34; with a heroin-addicted mother and a gun-toting, drug-pushing father. At the age of five, Caine learns how to shoot a gun and witnesses his father kill someone in cold blood. By the time of his high school graduation, he\&#39;s already a seasoned drug pusher. One night, he and his friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate) go into a store to get a beer. O-Dog takes exception to a remark made by the owner and, with Caine standing by his side, guns the man down. From this point on, the pair start down a road of crime that nothing can rescue them from--not even the fear of death. In fact, when Caine\&#39;s grandfather asks him if he wants to stay alive, his response is, &#34;I don\&#39;t know.&#34;\nThis will not be the only review written that compares MENACE II SOCIETY to BOYZ \&#39;N THE HOOD, but it may be the only one to liken the movie to RESERVOIR DOGS. As I see it, there are definite similarities between the Hughes Brother\&#39;s film and those of Singleton and Tarantino.\nThe setting of MENACE and BOYZ is the same and the overwhelming specter of explosive violence hangs over both. Each in its own way is a powerful indictment of what life has become for a black man in the inner city and how the only escape through violence is into the grave. While BOYZ \&#39;N THE HOOD has as its main characters a couple of &#34;good&#34; kids, MENACE II SOCIETY focuses on the other side. Caine and O-Dog are criminals, given to using their guns to solve problems. Nevertheless, they are portrayed sympathetically and the audience comes to understand and even care about Caine, even though it\&#39;s impossible to endorse his actions. Hence the comparison to RESERVOIR DOGS, a movie that, among other things, had a group of murdering thugs as its main characters, and whose success depended on the audience making an emotional connection with the villains.\nMENACE II SOCIETY has a number of lessons to teach, all of which are delivered without the whiff of a sermon. The story and characters are well-developed and we get to see graphically the wages of the kind of life that Caine and O-Dog have chosen. The lure of money, prestige, and power are realistically presented, but no moreso than the brutal payment that is exacted to obtain them. Also at issue is the necessity of a person accepting the consequences for his actions and how an apparently inconsequential event can trigger a disastrous chain-reaction.\nThis is one of the most devastating movies to come along in a while. Few films these days have the power to keep an audience sitting in stunned silence for the first few seconds of the final credits. This, if nothing else, is testimony to how hard-hitting the conclusion of MENACE is. The movie pulls no punches, and for that reason, some viewers may be offended. The gory results of violence are displayed with little concern for the sensibilities of the less-hardened members of the audience, and the explicit language earns MENACE II SOCIETY its &#34;R&#34; rating before the opening New Line Cinema logo leaves the screen.\nFor MENACE II SOCIETY to work, the characters have to be real. Especially in the case of Caine, into whose youth we are given a lingering look, they are. Equal credit must go to the writer and the actors. Except for Charles S. Dutton, whose role is little more than a two-scene cameo, none of the performers are well-known, but there isn\&#39;t a stiff in the bunch. The Hughes Brothers obviously knew what they wanted before going out and getting it.\nFrankly, this is not an enjoyable movie. It\&#39;s too stark and powerful to function as simple entertainment. Those that set foot in a darkened theater showing MENACE II SOCIETY should prepare for something in the nature of an experience. It won\&#39;t be a fun time, but you\&#39;ll sit through ninety-seven minutes that won\&#39;t quickly be forgotten.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: M. Night Shyamalan, Mike Muthu, Christabel Howie, Richa Ahuja, Arun Balachandran Director: M. Night Shyamalan Producer: M. Night Shyamalan Screenplay: M. Night Shyamalan Music: Edmund K. Choi Released by Northern Arts Entertainment\nDev Raman (M. Night Shyamalan) is an American-born Indian sent to India as part of a college student exchange program. Dev is reluctant to go, but his mother, to whom he is devoted, insists. So, friendless and alone, halfway across the world, Dev experiences culture shock--he may look like an Indian, but it is quickly and vividly demonstrated that looks are of little consequence, and it will take more than a glib tongue and an unwillingness to back down to earn acceptance and respect. In the midst of his initial travails, Dev\&#39;s sole friend is Sunjay (Mike Muthu), his guide and mentor, upon whose advice he relies. There are times, however, when he chooses to be headstrong and ignore Sunjay (on such issues as approaching a pretty girl or passively accepting the taunts of older students). Unsurprisingly, those incidents typically lead to embarrassment or worse.\nStories about clashing cultures are nothing new to movies. In recent years, the subject has formed the basis for comedies (such as the wildly popular 1986 release CROCODILE DUNDEE, about an Australian transplanted to New York), science fiction (STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME, about a group from the twenty-third century coping with modern-day San Francisco), and numerous dramas (including 1992\&#39;s CITY OF JOY and MISSISSIPPI MASALA). Now, PRAYING WITH ANGER can be added to the list. The debut film of M. Night Shyamalan (who produced, directed, wrote, and starred), PRAYING WITH ANGER attempts to present another perspective on this issue.\nComparisons with CITY OF JOY and MISSISSIPPI MASALA are appropriate. Like PRAYING WITH ANGER, both of those movies deal with friction between Indian and American traditions. However, where MASALA sets the story in the United States and CITY OF JOY makes the protagonist a white male adrift in Calcutta, PRAYING WITH ANGER sends an American born Indian to the &#34;home&#34; that he has never known.\nThe film is at its best when it explores Indian culture and tradition, and examines how Dev must adjust to live in what for him is a strange world. These scenes, which make up a majority of the first half of PRAYING WITH ANGER, are often fascinating. Shyamalan doesn\&#39;t reveal anything extraordinary, but neither does he shrink from showing the often-painful rigidity imposed by India\&#39;s caste divisions. Social class is very much an issue, both as it applies to Dev and the people that he comes to care about.\nUnfortunately, the basic plot is a series of formulas neatly bundled together. There\&#39;s the requisite tragic love story, the girl who bucks the centuries-old system, the outsider who comes to be respected by those who previously despised him, and, of course, the coming of age tale. PRAYING WITH ANGER lacks originality and inspiration, and after the initial interest has worn off, the story has a hard time holding the viewer\&#39;s attention. It\&#39;s always apparent what\&#39;s around the next corner, and the one after that as well.\nShyamalan occasionally has problems with dialogue. Most of the time, the lines are okay, but there are moments when he launches into jarring, overblown sermon-like lectures. We do not, for example, need to have it explicitly and repeatedly pointed out how beautiful the traditions of India are when the camerawork places them adequately on display.\nLike the dialogue, the characters are uneven. At times, the people in PRAYING WITH ANGER seem real, but there are occasions when they become foils for the plot. Dev\&#39;s sudden and complete transformation in the film\&#39;s final act is difficult to swallow, especially since we are never presented with enough evidence to justify such a radical swing in point-of-view.\nTo the credit of M. Night Shyamalan, he strove for something lavish and ambitious in this, his first effort. While PRAYING WITH ANGER is not a total success, there are enough glimpses of promise to indicate that Shyamalan may have a fine future in film making. However, beyond those brief-but-sterling moments, PRAYING WITH ANGER relies on too much stock material for it to be satisfying enough to warrant more than a passing interest.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Starring: Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Samantha Mathis, Fisher Stevens, Richard Edson Directors: Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel Producers: Jake Eberts and Roland Joffe Screenplay: Parker Bennett, Terry Runte, and Ed Solomon Music: Alan Silvestri Released by Hollywood Pictures\n65 million years ago, when an asteroid crashed into the Earth and obliterated the dinosaurs, a parallel dimension was created in which dinosaurs evolved into the dominant creature. Now, millennia later, King Koopa (Dennis Hopper) of Dinohatten wants to fuse the two dimensions together so that he can expand his domain (and increase the food supply). There are two elements necessary to his plan: a small chip of the asteroid broken off upon impact and Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis), who lives in the other dimension and, coincidentally, wears the asteroid chip as a necklace. Koopa sends his incompetent cousins Iggy (Fisher Stevens) and Spike (Richard Edson) through the bridge between worlds to capture Daisy, who is in the process of falling for Luigi Mario (John Leguizamo), an apprentice plumber. When, after numerous mistakes, Iggy and Spike finally capture her and take her back to their dimension, Luigi and his brother Mario Mario (Bob Hoskins) go to her rescue.\nDescribing the story of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is a difficult chore, considering how little intelligible plot there is. I suppose it&#39;s only natural to expect this, considering the source material for the movie. As we all know, arcade-style diversions are not known for strong, original storylines or well-developed characters. In that sense, this film is worthy of its inspiration.\nThe fun of playing the video game is that you&#39;re involved--you control what the little figure on the screen does. With the movie, on the other hand, you&#39;re a bystander, sitting in a seat watching a bunch of actors run around getting absolutely nothing done and speaking dialogue that could have been written by a precocious five-year old. Following an unnecessarily long opening sequence (which is actually the best part of the movie), SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is ninety-odd minutes of pointless action sequences which serve little purpose other than to keep the motion picture faithful to the spirit of the game. In doing so, however, they commit the cardinal sin of boring the audience. With no genuine sense of danger, there&#39;s no excitement.\nSome interesting casting choices were made. Bob Hoskins, who suddenly appears willing to lend his respected name to ventures of dubious quality, gives a solid-if-unspectacular performance as the older of the Mario brothers. John Leguizamo, on the other hand, is not good; earnestness doesn&#39;t compensate for lack of ability. Samantha Mathis, who has shown her skill in films such as PUMP UP THE VOLUME and THIS IS MY LIFE, plays an appealing, if somewhat gawky, college-aged princess. Dennis Hopper is disappointing. His role as King Koopa cries out for an over-the-top performance but, for some inexplicable reason, Hopper plays him straight, creating a dull and uncharismatic villain. This guy is so boring that we find it difficult to root against him--that is, when we can unravel enough of the murky plot to figure out why we&#39;re not supposed to like him.\nAdmittedly, the visual effects are nice, but it&#39;s a poor movie these days that can&#39;t have that said about it. There isn&#39;t anything new or revolutionary here. Back in 1979, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE proved that special effects alone, no matter how impressive, cannot sustain the interest of an audience. What was true then remains so today. SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is all glitz and no substance, and makes for a pretty poor time at the movies. If you crave excitement and action, see CLIFFHANGER.\nKids will probably love this film but, to be frank, most children aren&#39;t that discriminating (apologies to the few who are). There&#39;s nothing in the film that&#39;s reprehensible (although some may find the concept of a one-hundred-five-minute commercial for a game offensive in itself), but I find it hard to believe that many adults accompanying their youngsters will be entertained.\nIn general, about the best recommendation I can come up with regarding this movie is to turn on the Nintendo and play a game yourself. You&#39;ll have more fun, spend less money, and it will be over a whole lot faster.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Date Released: 5/21/93 Running Length: 1:27 Rated: PG-13 (Sexual situations, brief nudity, mock violence)\nStarring: Charlie Sheen, Valeria Golino, Lloyd Bridges, Richard Crenna, Brenda Bakke, Miguel Ferrer Director: Jim Abrahams Producer: Bill Badalato Screenplay: Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft Music: Basil Poledouris Released by Twentieth Century Fox\nSince being inexplicably dumped by Ramada (Valeria Golino), the love of his life, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen), the earstwhile hero of HOT SHOTS!, has retreated into a monastery to contemplate the meaning of life. His time of solitude comes to an end, however, when his good friend and former superior, Colonel Denton Walters (Richard Crenna), is captured by Saddam Hussein, and a sexy female CIA operative (Brenda Bakke) arrives at the monastery to recruit Topper for the rescue mission. Biceps bulging and guns blazing, Topper charges into Iraq, letting nothing get in his way.\nTwo years ago, I gave the original HOT SHOTS! a scathing review, calling it &#34;one of the most unfunny and sophomoric movies&#34; of the year. Fortunately, while PART DEUX is just as silly and dumb as it predecessor, it manages a more humorous edge. As a result, the sequel is more watchable than the original. Better than the actual film, however, is its theatrical trailer, which shows a number of scenes not in the finished product (they look to have been produced explicitly for the trailer).\nWhat HOT SHOTS! did for TOP GUN, PART DEUX does for the Rambo movies. Charlie Sheen has bulked up impressively for this role and, with unbound hair hanging to his shoulders and ammo encasing his body, he looks eerily like the posters of Sylvester Stallone from the second and third FIRST BLOODs. Then there\&#39;s Richard Crenna, here in a role that\&#39;s obviously a sendup of the one he played in the other series. Of course, PART DEUX doesn\&#39;t stop with Rambo, getting its digs in at dozens of other targets ranging from the easily-lampooned BASIC INSTINCT to LADY AND THE TRAMP.\nBad puns, double entendres, and dumb sight gags abound (what else would you expect from Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft?). With as many as there are, it\&#39;s only to be expected that quite a few are duds. Unfortunately, a disproportionate number of the failures occur during the last third of the movie, causing PART DEUX to be unbalanced. The first hour is decently paced as the humor keeps it afloat, but the final portion of the film is occasionally tedious.\nThere are a couple of real winners in PART DEUX. Most memorable are a cameo by Martin Sheen, a spoof of SEA HUNT featuring the original star (Lloyd Bridges), a slapstick gathering of the living presidents, and an on-screen digital &#34;body count&#34; meter during the climactic raid on Saddam\&#39;s fortress.\nSheen and Golino wade through this film with gloriously deadpan expressions, playing it straight no matter how outlandish the story becomes. As is true of Leslie Nielsen in the NAKED GUN pictures, this is one of the film\&#39;s assets. Satire often works best when it\&#39;s intentionally modelled after bad drama. Oddly enough, one wonders if the Rambo films were the best choice for a spoof, since the second and third installments came close to self-parody in their own right.\nNevertheless, not enough of PART DEUX gels to make it an unqualified success, even for its genre. There are too many instances when the film is too obvious in its attempts at humor. Forcing jokes more often leads to them falling flat than working and, in PART DEUX, this happens on several occasions.\nThose that enjoyed the original HOT SHOTS! will doubtless be entertained by the second part, as will moviegoers who laughed their way through LOADED WEAPON ONE. The stuff of PART DEUX is not AIRPLANE material, but it has its high points, and as a mindless summer evening out, it will certainly deliver what\&#39;s expected from it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Fifteen years ago, Michael Chapman (Michael J. Fox) was a pint-sized TV superstar, the wisecracking cute kid on a sitcom called LIFE WITH MIKEY. Now, long after leaving professional acting behind, he and his brother Ed (Nathan Lane) run a talent agency for children with marginal-to-nonexistent ability. Their fortunes are sinking quickly until Michael runs into ten-year-old pickpocket Angie Vega on the street. So impressed is he by the performance she gives when she\&#39;s caught lifting some guy\&#39;s wallet that he invites her to the agency for an audition.\nEvery summer movie season has its blockbuster duds; surprise hits; and dull, brainless, formula &#34;family films&#34; guaranteed to fall between the cracks. LIFE WITH MIKEY belongs firmly in the third category. This is a vapid film, with little to recommend it save its lack of anything offensive. The draw is that parents can take their offspring to the theater without fear of hearing a string of profanity, seeing someone get shot or mauled, or being bombarded by half-naked women running across the screen. Unfortunately, such &#34;wholesomeness&#34; is not nearly enough reason to spend money and time on LIFE WITH MIKEY.\nActually, this looks more like a made-for-TV movie than something developed for theatrical release (although, from the start, it was always intended for the big screen). The production quality is low and the script a product of the plot-by-numbers division of Hollywood. Little more intelligence has been put into the main story than was included in the intentionally-awful clips we see from LIFE WITH MIKEY.\nSomething interesting in the premise got lost in the movie\&#39;s transition from an idea to the final product. Having Michael J. Fox play a kid-star who becomes a nothing as an adult (no money, no recognition, and no self-respect) is a potentially-intriguing prospect, but LIFE WITH MIKEY does little to build on this theme. Instead, it spends most of its time on the barbed-tongue wrangling between Michael and his discovery. This is the umpteenth movie in which the child melts the heart of a cynical adult while the adult shows her/him that someone cares. It\&#39;s a tale that Hollywood has done to death, and this movie has nothing to add to it.\nOne of the few surprises about LIFE WITH MIKEY is the movie\&#39;s lack of energy. Caused by a combination of &#34;mail-in-the-performance&#34; acting, poor directing, a routine music score (by Alan Menken, who seems to get worse with every soundtrack), and pedestrian camerawork, the sense of lethargy pervades every scene, threatening to lull the unsuspecting viewer to sleep. There are a couple of funny moments, but they neither last long nor are they memorable enough to recall after the final credits roll.\nMichael J. Fox has never been a great comic actor, but he usually does an adequate job (as in BACK TO THE FUTURE and DOC HOLLYWOOD). Not so in LIFE WITH MIKEY. Perhaps he\&#39;s trying to parody himself as an ex-young TV star, but his character comes across as completely unconvincing. Christina Vidal, a newcomer, supplies the only brief bursts of liveliness available in this otherwise-stagnant picture, but she still has a lot of rough edges. Too often, it\&#39;s plain that she\&#39;s acting.\nLIFE WITH MIKEY is a subpar piece of film making for which the producers\&#39; intentions are all-too-apparent. In slapping together a formula-riddled picture, they hope to cash in on the early-summer family-oriented audience (those that are questing for something to see before the re-release of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES). Considering the creative limitations of this project, such blatant marketing is patently offensive. Those with a yen to see something for the whole family can find hundreds of better offerings on video, and fans of Michael J. Fox would do better to peruse old episodes of FAMILY TIES. At least back then, he appeared to care about what he was doing.\n&#39;,
 &#39;David Greenhill (Don Johnson) is about to go on trial for the murder of his rich socialite wife. To prepare his defense, he solicits one of the best young female lawyers in the country, Jennifer Haines (Rebecca DeMornay). After an initial bout of reluctance, Jennifer decides to take the case--she realizes that David is a womanizer and manipulator, but she believes him to be innocent (&#34;People who are guilty are rarely this blunt,&#34; she confesses) and sees his case as a challenge. However, from the moment she accepts him as a client, she finds herself in over her head as David, obviously not possessing the most stable of personalities, begins to toy with her personal life-- and her mind.\nTrials and questions of guilt and innocence are nothing new, but GUILTY AS SIN has a few twists that give this film a different slant than many other courtroom thriller/dramas. Limited though it is, the strength of this picture lies not in a tense verbal jousting match between prosecuting and defense attorneys, because there isn\&#39;t one, nor is it to be found in the &#34;did he do it/didn\&#39;t he&#34; theme, since the truth is revealed relatively early. Instead, the centerpiece is the cat-and-mouse game played between Jennifer and David as the two twist and manipulate circumstances, people, and each other. Much of the story, while admittedly overplotted, is cleverly-conceived and fun to watch. That\&#39;s what makes the ending such a colossal disappointment.\nOften, the final act of a film has little impact on the overall quality of the product. There are a number of good films that have weak conclusions, and a few horrible movies that surprise with unexpectedly-solid wrap-ups. GUILTY AS SIN, however, is an example of how an ending can ruin the entire picture. Without revealing anything plot-wise, let me simply state the final moments lead to an inept and feeble letdown. Everything that was carefully developed during the first ninety-five minutes is thrown away in the last ten. It\&#39;s almost as if someone different was brought in to do the writing. What\&#39;s worse is that it\&#39;s easy to construct scenarios that would have made a fitting conclusion to an otherwise-intriguing and entertaining film.\nWhile the end of GUILTY AS SIN is by far the film\&#39;s most grievous fault, it is by no means the only sour point. Some of the dialogue could have used a re-write or two. There are a number of lines that are unintentionally funny, and this is a bad sign for a movie trying to develop tension. There\&#39;s also a truly horrible performance given by Stephen Lang, who fails to infuse his Phil Garson (Jennifer\&#39;s lover) with anything remotely resembling humanity. Fortunately, he doesn\&#39;t have a large role.\nRebecca DeMornay is inconsistent. There are scenes when she does an excellent job, but an equal number when she is amateurish, stilted, or unconvincing. She\&#39;s at her best playing someone of cool, ruthless intelligence and at her worst attempting to give an impression of vulnerability. Strong emotion appears to be something that she has difficulty portraying effectively.\nDon Johnson, on the other hand, is wildly charismatic as David Greenhill. He plays the role to the hilt, pulling out all the stops and more than occasionally overacting. What he does is perfect for the movie, and immensely fun to watch (it also helps to erase the memory of an execrable performance in Born Yesterday). There aren\&#39;t many movies when I find myself sympathizing with the villain, but this is among the exceptions, Johnson\&#39;s acting putting me solidly in Greenhill\&#39;s corner. Oddly enough, another recent example of this occurred when I rooted for DeMornay\&#39;s Paige in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.\nComparisons can be made to JAGGED EDGE, but most of the similarities are superficial. Aside from EDGE being a better-crafted piece of entertainment, there\&#39;s a lot to differentiate the two. While it\&#39;s true that Jack Warden\&#39;s character in GUILTY AS SIN is uncannily like Robert Loggia\&#39;s in EDGE, and that in both films there\&#39;s a strange attraction between the female lawyer and a client that she believes to be innocent, each of the movies focuses on something different. GUILTY AS SIN pushes Greenhill\&#39;s guilt or innocence into the background, along with his trial, to zero in on his bizarre and weirdly fascinating relationship with Jennifer.\nGUILTY AS SIN will not win any awards for realism, but as escapism it\&#39;s fine--until the ending, that is. It\&#39;s disappointing and amazing how a few ill-conceived pages of script can shatter what might otherwise have been a shallow-but-enjoyable thriller. What a waste.\n&#39;,
 &#39;What starts as a simple village squabble gets escalated rapidly in THE STORY OF QUI JU. The movie starts with Qui (Gong Li) taking her injured husband Qailing (Liu Pei Qi) to see the doctor. He has just had a fight with the village chief (Lei Lao Sheng), who beat him up. When Qui goes to the authorities to seek recompense for her husband\&#39;s injury, she receives little in the way of satisfaction. While they are willing to grant Qailing monetary compensation, they will not compel the chief to apologize, which is what Qui really wants. So, despite an advanced pregnancy, she begins a series of long treks to distant districts and cities in an attempt to attain justice.\nAt times, THE STORY OF QUI JU is a bitingly amusing satire on the process commonly known as the &#34;bureaucratic runaround&#34;. This film goes to new extremes to lampoon a process that can make righteous satisfaction a difficult thing to come by. Throughout the film, all Qui wants is a simple apology, but the lengths that she has to go to, and the money that she has to spend, in an attempt to secure it, is astonishing. In the end, we\&#39;re treated to the most bitter irony of all.\nUnfortunately, while QUI JU is sporadically funny, it is also slow-moving to the point of distraction. There is too much back-and-forth, and the story begins to drag well before the halfway point. Boring is too extreme a term for the film since there are a number of memorable highlights, but there are occasions when THE STORY OF QUI JU may lose the attention of some of its viewers.\nIf there was no other reason to see this picture, at least it can be cited as a good lesson in some of the cultural distinctions of rural mainland China. It\&#39;s refreshing to get an insider\&#39;s view in a film not specifically intended for outsiders. This way, we see things in a normal, natural setting, not as staged moments designed to impress foreigners. There are times when this aspect of the film almost makes up for the plodding pace.\nDirector Zhang Yimou and actress Gong Li have been reunited for the third time (they previously worked together in JU DOU and RAISE THE RED LANTERN). Li\&#39;s style of acting is marvelously fresh and entirely different from anything originating in a Western country. Her performance is understated, and effective because of it. There is never any sense of melodrama, and Qui\&#39;s subtle displays of exasperation at the lengths to which she must go to get a fair hearing are completely believable.\nNot only does QUI JU tackle the issue of bureaucracy, but it also takes pains to point out the dangers of pride. Whatever ego Qui has is minimal. She doesn\&#39;t want revenge; she wants justice; and she\&#39;s willing to go to any lengths to obtain it. The village chief, on the other hand, is willing to do anything except apologize, and this is where the crux of the conflict lies. Were he a little less stubborn, Qui\&#39;s actions would be unnecessary.\nFor those who enjoy pictures with little action, a minimalist plot, decent characterization, and a good eye for small details, THE STORY OF QUI JU may be worthwhile viewing. Beware that this is a very un-American movie--everything about it is distinctly foreign--and perhaps its greatest value lies in what it can teach. Nevertheless, the pace of QUI JU borders on ponderous, so a reasonable attention span is requisite. There are rewards to be had from a viewing of Zhang Yimou\&#39;s latest, but they don\&#39;t come without a price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: 6/11/93; wide release 6/18/93 Running Length: 1:58 Rated: R (Language, violence, sex, mature themes)\nStarring: Angela Bassett, Laurence Fishburne Director: Brian Gibson Producers: Doug Chapin and Barry Krost Screenplay: Kate Lanier, based on I, TINA, by Tina Turner and Kurt Loder Music: Stanley Clarke Released by Touchstone Pictures\nWHAT\&#39;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a biographical sketch of the life of Tina Turner (played by Angela Bassett), concentrating on the years between the late 1950s and the early 1980s. The focus is primarily on Ms. Turner\&#39;s disastrous marriage to Ike Turner (Larry Fishburne), the man who created her career while nearly destroying her life. Her struggles to escape from under his abusive thumb and make it on her own fuel this surprisingly effective film.\nGoing into the movie, I have to admit that I wasn\&#39;t optimistic. It\&#39;s all-too-easy to put together an exploitative film based on the life of a well-known musical figure or group, and foist it on an unsuspecting public. Oliver Stone proved with THE DOORS that just because someone in the music business is surrounded by controversy, that doesn\&#39;t mean that his or her life will translate into an enjoyable motion picture. However, where I found the story of Jim Morrison\&#39;s life to be dull and pretentious, I discovered energy and passion in WHAT\&#39;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.\nThe music scenes are electric. Superbly acted and choreographed, they are some of the best of their kind to be found in any recent movie. While the voice of Tina Turner covers all her own songs, it\&#39;s impossible to tell that Angela Bassett\&#39;s voice is being dubbed out. Laurence Fishburne does his own singing. The choice of music for the soundtrack is also noteworthy; many of the songs will be familiar to even those who have had limited exposure to Ike and Tina Turner.\nPunctuating the film\&#39;s energized performances are several darkly violent scenes. These are frighteningly intense and starkly graphic, not because they are especially bloody (although blood is in evidence), but because the participants do such an excellent job at bringing to the surface highly- believable emotions during the circumstances. Often, abuse scenes are over-dramatized, but WHAT\&#39;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT avoids that trap. The goal of realism is attained.\nAngela Bassett, who was Betty Shabazz in MALCOLM X, plays an outstanding Tina Turner. Physically, she bears only a passing resemblance to the singer (this is reinforced when Turner makes a brief appearance in the final moments of the film during a concert), but she has the mannerisms, vocal patterns, and explosive energy captured perfectly.\nLarry Fishburne was already widely-known and well-respected coming into WHAT\&#39;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, but his performance as Ike Turner will enhance his reputation. He gets to play the hero and the villain--the slickly charismatic singer transformed by jealousy and drugs into a brutal beast. Any Jekyll and Hyde personae demands ability and range, both elements of which Fishburne exhibits. His Ike Turner has many facets, transcending the level of the common &#34;bad husband&#34; (much as his character in DEEP COVER gave that movie more substance than the script strove for).\nWHAT\&#39;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is an exceptionally-paced movie. Credit director Brian Gibson for this. He avoids the tendency of biographies to get mired in irrelevancies. The film, nearly two hours long, seems much shorter than its running length. Gibson also manages to neatly transition his project through the turbulent decades of the sixties and seventies, effectively capturing the essence of those eras. It\&#39;s not just the costumes and hairdos that reflect the times, but the attitudes of the participants as well.\nYou don\&#39;t have to be a Tina Turner fan to appreciate this movie, but no matter how you feel about her music, WHAT\&#39;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT cannot fail to impart an impression of her courage and inner strength. Although ultimately a triumphant story, this biography doesn\&#39;t see its subject through rose-colored glasses. It takes chances, and that\&#39;s why the movie works. Visually impressive and aurally dazzling, WHAT\&#39;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a great alternative to some of the bloated, overbudgeted summer films.\n&#39;,

Molen Screenplay: Michael Crichton and David Koepp based on the book by Michael Crichton Music: John Williams Released by Universal Pictures\nOn a small island off the coast of Costa Rica exists a most unusual animal preserve by the name of Jurassic Park. Operated by dinosaur lover John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), Jurassic Park is the first of its kind. Its population of creatures includes brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, tricerotops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, each of which has been cloned using the latest technology that takes DNA from dinosaur-biting prehistoric insects preserved in amber, and uses that DNA for the re- creation. When the consortium funding Jurassic Park become concerned that all is not as it should be, Hammond is forced to call in three experts: paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his partner, paleo-botanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and the brilliant-but-cynical mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When the trio arrives at Jurassic Park, they are astonished by what it represents. It doesn\&#39;t take long, however, for astonishment to turn to horror.\nFirst of all, for anyone who\&#39;s wondering, given the current state of technology, the situation postulated in JURASSIC PARK cannot happen. Not only do the necessary cloning techniques not exist, but the likelihood of retrieving dinosaur DNA from an amber-encased prehistoric mosquito is extremely small. While insect specimens have been unearthed, for there to be dinosaur DNA, circumstances demand that the mosquito had bitten a dinosaur shortly before its fatal imprisonment, and the chance of that is slim, at best.\nNevertheless, the enjoyment of any movie is hardly predicated by a factual premise. The apparent realism of some of Crichton\&#39;s pseudo-science imbues JURASSIC PARK with a grounding that is acceptable in our high-tech world. After all, to weave a dinosaur fable in this day and age, science--not fantasy--must be the driving force. The science may not be real, but it must sound good enough to allow a suspension of disbelief. In that, this film (and the book that spawned it) succeeds.\nOf course, the special effects help immensely. They are so good, in fact, and the dinosaurs look so real, that I half expected to see &#34;dinosaur trainer&#34; during the closing credits. Instead, however, honor should be heaped upon the creators of JURASSIC PARK\&#39;s primary screen presences (all apologies to the actors). Stan Winston, definitely not a stranger to this sort of film (his recent credits include ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2), is credited with the live-action creatures. Dennis Muren gets his due for the full motion monsters. Phil Tippett is the &#34;dinosaur supervisor&#34;, and Michael Lantieri presides over the creature effects. All-in-all, the wizards at ILM have done an outstanding job, giving us by far the most impressive and believable monster movie of all time. Nothing compares.\nWould that the story is the equal of its execution. To begin with, Crichton\&#39;s book, while filled with fascinating ideas and entertaining moments, hardly holds together as a top-of-the-line adventure story. The ending is especially problematic, resulting in a forty-page denouement that drags slowly to an anticlimactic conclusion. As a result, a script based closely on the book is bound to suffer from some of the same problems. Despite numerous small changes and omissions, the movie JURASSIC PARK is very much faithful to its printed inspiration. Perhaps Michael Crichton\&#39;s involvement in the screenplay has something to do with this.\nThe biggest weakness of the novel is characterization, and the same flaw is fully evident in the screen adaptation. There are a few exceptions. The scenes between Alan and Ellie at the beginning are well-done, with the affection between them evident from the start (a change from the book, where the two were never a couple). This is as much a tribute to the acting of Sam Neill and Laura Dern as to the writing. Also noteworthy is a scene where Ellie confronts Hammond, who\&#39;s eating a dish of ice cream in the midst of the crisis. Here, we get a sense of what\&#39;s going on inside the old man\&#39;s head. In the book, he\&#39;s a mixed-up fanatic, but in the film, he\&#39;s made into a sympathetic, albeit eccentric, figure.\nInterestingly, some transposition has gone on between Hammond\&#39;s two grandchildren. Tim (Joseph Mazzello) is still the dinosaur-lover, but the screen\&#39;s version of the boy is younger than his sister Alexis (Ariana Richards). The flip-flop in age creates a difference in their relationship and they come across as closer and less-adversarial on screen. Also, here it\&#39;s Alexis, not Tim, who\&#39;s the computer whiz.\nThe plot is little more than a cleverly jumbled-together batch of formulas. As I mentioned before, JURASSIC PARK is, reduced to its most basic level, a monster movie. Thrown in for good measure is the human interest story--the growing relationship between self-confessed child-hater Grant and his two youthful charges--but this part of the film worked least successfully for me. Also, there isn\&#39;t an effective ending. Too much is left dangling, demanding that the lion\&#39;s share of the resolution be confined to the imagination, but at least the movie avoids the book\&#39;s plodding conclusion.\nNevertheless, I doubt that there are many who will go to JURASSIC PARK for its characters or story. Rightly so, crowds will flock to the theaters screening this movie so they can ooh and aah, jump in their seats, and root for the overmatched humans against the big, bad dinosaurs. When it comes to adventure, JURASSIC PARK is a roller-coaster ride. With thrills and action in the tradition of, but not up to the level of, ALIENS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (another Spielberg picture), this is an exciting and energetic film with a number of shocks but few letdowns. Even those familiar with the written work can\&#39;t help being drawn in to the pulse- pounding exhilaration of the chase as the Tyrannosaurus menaces two powerless electric cars and the trapped humans inside.\nIn the end, JURASSIC PARK succeeds because it\&#39;s good entertainment--a fun night at the movies. Unlike something of the ilk of CLIFFHANGER, which also boasts a lot of action, there\&#39;s some intelligence behind this picture. JURASSIC PARK isn\&#39;t great art, nor is it classic cinema, but at least we don\&#39;t feel like the producers and director are more interested in getting as much firepower and death on-screen as they can without giving a thought as to whether anyone in the audience has a brain.\nNot having seen all of the summer\&#39;s offerings (THE LAST ACTION HERO is still a week away), I can\&#39;t say how JURASSIC PARK will rate overall, but I will admit that, in my opinion, this is the first big-budget film in a long time to live up to its pre-release reputation. Sure, the movie isn\&#39;t perfect, but it delivers--perhaps more than delivers--what the average viewer will expect from it. Summer has long been known as the season for action/adventure films, and JURASSIC PARK falls firmly into that category.\nBecause of the nature and scope of this movie, I would encourage anyone with more than a passing interest to catch JURASSIC PARK in a movie theater. It will lose a lot on the smaller TV screen. Without the grandeur of a stereophonic sound system and sizeable picture, much of this film\&#39;s impact will dwindle away. The dinosaurs will still look real, but there will undoubtedly be some who, upon viewing JURASSIC PARK on video, will wonder what all the fuss is about.\nTo this praise, let me add a final word of caution. While the violence in this film is not particularly graphic, it is apparent. People aren\&#39;t shown getting gored or ripped apart, but the movie makes it perfectly clear what is happening. Parents considering taking young children (under around 10 years of age) to JURASSIC PARK might be advised to see the film first. There are certainly a number of scary and potentially-disturbing moments which, while they add to the spice for older viewers, may be inappropriate for younger ones.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: 6/18/93 Running Length: 2:10 Rated: PG-13 (Violence)\nStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Austin O\&#39;Brien, Charles Dance, Anthony Quinn, F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Mercedes Reuhl Director: John McTiernan Producers: Steve Roth and John McTiernan Screenplay: Shane Black and David Arnott based on a story by Zak Penn and Adam Leff Music: Michael Kamen Released by Columbia Pictures\nDanny (Austin O\&#39;Brien) is addicted to Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) movies. He\&#39;s seen the third one six times and now he\&#39;s eagerly awaiting the released of JACK SLATER IV. When his elderly friend Nick (Robert Prosky), the projectionist at a run-down theater, tells Danny that he can sneak him in for an advance screening of the new flick, the kid is excited. The next day, when he arrives at the appointed hour (midnight, when all strange things happen), Nick lets him in and presents him with a &#34;magic&#34; ticket. There\&#39;s a long story that goes with this, the gist of which is that the ticket purportedly has the ability to transport its user to other worlds, but it has a &#34;mind of its own&#34;. Soon after Danny sits down to enjoy the movie, he discovers exactly what Nick meant by that phrase. The seat in the safe comfort of the theater suddenly becomes the floor of Jack Slater\&#39;s car. Danny is no longer watching the movie--he\&#39;s in it.\nThe critics have panned LAST ACTION HERO and, given my propensity for blasting anything that bills Arnold Schwarzenegger as its main attraction, one might assume that I didn\&#39;t enjoy it either. Not so. While LAST ACTION HERO certainly isn\&#39;t the banner movie of the summer, it\&#39;s not nearly as horrible as most of the radio/TV/print reviewers would like you to believe.\nAdmittedly, this is not a good action film. Given its billing, director, and title, that\&#39;s a surprise. On the other hand, LAST ACTION HERO works as an unexpectedly witty comedy. In fact, I found this movie to be more amusing (not to mention more watchable) than Schwarzenegger\&#39;s two openly billed comic entries, TWINS and KINDERGARTEN COP.\nThe humor ranges from that staple of the action genre--bad puns--to some pretty incisive satire. Even though this next assertion is going to cause a lot of people to cringe, I\&#39;ll make it anyway. I can find a number of similarities between LAST ACTION HERO and (believe it or not) Robert Altman\&#39;s THE PLAYER. No, this isn\&#39;t nearly as nasty or intelligent a picture as the Spring 1992 release, but both movies have a lot of fun blasting Hollywood genre films. Arnold\&#39;s production may be more good-natured about it (after all, he\&#39;s made his name and most of his fortune out of these kind of popcorn-and-soda movies), but there\&#39;s no mistaking the intent. There\&#39;s hardly a plot device of the action film that goes without some kind of dig. The car chase, the shoot-out, the exploding vehicles and houses, the death-defying jumps, the triumph over impossible odds, the last-second escape--all of these, and more, get lampooned in LAST ACTION HERO.\nOn the other hand, there is fundamental problem in the movie--the action sequences, which are numerous, are not exciting. Sure, they\&#39;re directed with flair and energy, but the certain knowledge that nothing remotely bad is going to happen to Arnold or his pint-sized sidekick takes away any possible suspense. McTiernan has given us a lot of flashes and bangs, but, aside from the laughs generated by the parodies, there isn\&#39;t much for us to sink our teeth into. The pulse-pounding, sizzling pull of a DIE HARD is absent.\nPlot problems abound, but at least the story is more coherent than CLIFFHANGER. Since it\&#39;s a fantasy, a great deal (such as the horrible plot device of the ticket) can be forgiven, although there are several instances where LAST ACTION HERO violates its own terms for inner consistency. Some of the things that go on in JACK SLATER IV, a live-action cartoon, are enjoyable. There\&#39;s an incredibly over-the-top car chase (with cars flying off bridges and landing safely far below) that\&#39;s a lot of fun (too bad most of the other action scenes aren\&#39;t as memorable). However, before the setting switches to the &#34;real world&#34;, the pacing becomes sluggish. Once the freshness of the satire has worn off, everything becomes routine.\nBack in New York, things get revitalized for a while. We get to see Arnold play himself as something of a shallow, media hog who is pushed around by his wife (Maria Shriver, playing herself). It\&#39;s to Schwarzenegger\&#39;s credit that he doesn\&#39;t shrink away from self-mockery. In fact, given the opportunity, he launches himself whole-heartedly into it.\nThe ending of LAST ACTION HERO is pathetic. By the last fifteen minutes, the uniqueness and fun have all drained away, and there\&#39;s nothing in the climax to liven things up. Perhaps if the villains (a one-eyed sharpshooter named Benedict, played by Charles Dance, and a homicidal lunatic called only &#34;The Slasher&#34;, played by Tom Noonan) had been more charismatic, the usual end-of-the-film heroics would have been enjoyable, but these are not the kind of bad guys that the audience can really enjoy hating. This is especially disappointing, since McTiernan directed Alan Rickman\&#39;s standout performance as the slick-tongued, despicable nasty in DIE HARD.\nThere\&#39;s also an interesting plot thread that\&#39;s not developed at all. Using the magic ticket, it\&#39;s possible to bring any screen character to life in the real world. Imagine what the film could have been like with Draculas, Terminators, and all sorts of other unworldly creatures roaming around. Alas, the device is hardly used.\nAs with THE PLAYER (and a number of other recent movies), cameos abound. The likes of James Belushi, Sharon Stone, Hammer, and Jean-Claude Van Damme make appearances. There are also countless references and homages to movies both old and new. The best wedding of a tribute with a cameo involves Joan Plowright, the widow of the late Laurence Olivier. As a school-teacher introducing her class to a clip from Olivier\&#39;s HAMLET, the eminent British actress tells the students that they might recognize Olivier from CLASH OF THE TITANS.\nAlso notable in the area of takeoffs is Schwarzenegger\&#39;s portrayal of a gun-toting Hamlet, although most of this sequence has been shown in the previews, so there\&#39;s little new for theatrical viewing. There\&#39;s also a running gag involving the line &#34;I\&#39;ll be back&#34; but, again, the key scene is in the trailers and TV ads.\nAs usual, Arnold is far more impressive as a screen presence than an actor. He has a certain style that lends itself to action and comedy. On those rare occasions when he\&#39;s forced to do a straight, semi-dramatic scene (such as when Slater recalls a rooftop tragedy that happened in his past), Schwarzenegger\&#39;s performance comes across with a dull thud. Please don\&#39;t let anyone risk putting this man in a serious movie!\nThe musical score by Michael Kamen, which consists primarily of a lot of loud hard rock combined with a few bars of classical, is far too intrusive. For the most part, music, much like camerawork, should be a background element in a movie. In LAST ACTION HERO, it\&#39;s very much in the foreground.\nKids will like this movie. While it\&#39;s true that there\&#39;s a lot of violence in LAST ACTION HERO, none of it is graphic. The explosions, gunplay, and killings are no more extreme than anything shown on a violent television cops-and-robbers show. Unlike JURASSIC PARK, there\&#39;s nothing here that\&#39;s likely to cause nightmares for anyone over the age of eight (or thereabouts).\nMaybe LAST ACTION HERO won\&#39;t be able to top JURASSIC PARK at the box office, but I don\&#39;t expect it to be a disaster, either. For my money, this movie is one of Arnold\&#39;s better recent offerings (With the possible exception of TOTAL RECALL, about which I have mixed feelings, I haven\&#39;t been enamored with much of what he\&#39;s done since the original TERMINATOR). Comparisons to HUDSON HAWK are undeserved. The same tongue-in-cheek style is evident, but this is a vastly superior effort.\nLAST ACTION HERO is a fun movie, and most of Arnold\&#39;s large legion of fans will be pleased by what he\&#39;s given them. The number of people who hate this film will probably be dwarfed by those who enjoy it, and critical opinion rarely makes much difference with this sort of picture. No one is going to call LAST ACTION HERO a great film, but it provides a decent two hours worth of entertainment (it\&#39;s about ten to fifteen minutes too long), and that\&#39;s a lot better than many of 1993\&#39;s offerings.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Pauly Shore, Carla Gugino, Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Mason Adams, Dan Gauthier Director: Steve Rash Producers: Michael Rotenberg and Peter M. Lenkov Screenplay: Fax Bahr, Adam Small, and Shawn Schepps based on a story by Patrick J. Clifton, Susan McMartin, and Peter M. Lenkov Music: Richard Gibbs Released by Hollywood Pictures\nFollowing graduation from a small school in Midwestern America, Rebecca Warner (Carla Gugino) opts for a change. Instead of sticking close to home, she wants to go to college in Southern California. Although her father Walter (Lane Smith) and mother Connie (Cindy Pickett) are uncertain about the idea, they agree that it\&#39;s Becca\&#39;s life, and make the two-day drive to her new school. There they encounter her Residential Advisor, Crawl (Pauly Shore). The next time the Warners meet Crawl, it\&#39;s when he comes home for Thanksgiving with Rebecca. The person who gets off the plane isn\&#39;t the same shy, reserved girl that left three months ago, but her change in attitude and appearance isn\&#39;t the only surprise she has in store for her family. In order to get out of marrying an old boyfriend (Dan Gauthier), she pretends to be engaged to Crawl.\nSome people like Pauly Shore (mostly teenagers, I suspect). After all, if those people didn\&#39;t exist, SON-IN-LAW would have never been made. Clearly, the role of Crawl was scripted specifically for him. Oddly enough, with someone marginally less annoying, this could have been a somewhat charming, albeit predictable, film. But to put Shore in a romantic comedy is asking for trouble.\nThere are times when it almost works, but most of those occasions are when he abandons his stupid stage personae and does something that approaches acting. Unfortunately, there are too few of those moments and, as soon as they pass, the aggravating side of Mr. Shore quickly re-surfaces. There are times when it becomes exceptionally difficult to accept--not to mention like--the character of Crawl.\nThe film has its humorous scenes, but these are formula-driven and lacking in originality. Perhaps the most inventive moment of SON-IN-LAW comes as the result of a cameo by Brenden Frasier, reprising the role he played in last summer\&#39;s dud, ENCINO MAN. It says something about the rest of this film to site that as one of SON-IN-LAW\&#39;s highlights.\nThe plot is stock romantic comedy material, complete with the usual misunderstandings, break-ups, and resolutions. The ending of SON-IN-LAW is so sickeningly sweet that I almost went into sugar shock. This gives an entirely new meaning to the term &#34;happy ending.&#34; Blech. I\&#39;m not against happy endings in general, but this kind of sappiness is impossible to stomach.\nCarla Gugino, who has the somewhat thankless role of Rebecca, does a fine job with the material she\&#39;s been given. In many ways, she reminds me of Kimberly Williams (Steve Martin\&#39;s daughter in the remake of FATHER OF THE BRIDE). Both have a certain freshness that\&#39;s enjoyable to watch. This is especially true of Gugino in this film, where she mercifully gives us a stable counterbalance to Shore\&#39;s idiotic antics.\nSince SON-IN-LAW takes place on a farm, there exists the usual run of city-boy-out-of-his-element gags. Of course, there\&#39;s a cow milking scene, and Shore gets to feed the pigs, pluck a turkey, and try his hand at fishing. It\&#39;s all pretty routine stuff. The few laughs garnered by this line of tried-and-true humor aren\&#39;t worth sitting through ninety-five minutes of lame drivel.\nSON-IN-LAW is a singularly unexceptional comedy, the content of which is well-represented by the theater trailers and TV ads. It\&#39;s perfect fare for watching on cable, but not worth the time or effort of making a trip to a theater. Those who can\&#39;t stand Pauly Shore would do well to stay away, and those that love him will go regardless of what I say. So, for those who don\&#39;t care one way or another, be aware that SON-IN-LAW gives exactly what you expect: a dumb, predictable romantic comedy that has more animals than laughs.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Featuring the voices of Michael Crawford, Ben Vereen, Ellen Blain, and Paige Gosney Director: Charles Grosvenor Producers: David Kirschner and Jerry Mills Screenplay: Mark Young and Kelly Ward Music: James Horner Released by Twentieth Century Fox\nA small group of forest critters goes on a quest to find herbs with which to heal their friend after the local village has been devastated as the result of a gas spill. This is the premise of the lackluster and very politically correct ONCE UPON A FOREST, the latest subpar G-rated animated feature to go after the money of parents in search of suitable entertainment for their young offspring.\nWith its recent three animated features, Disney has proven that animation capable of entertaining adults (as well as children) is not dead. I enjoyed THE LITTLE MERMAID, was enthralled by BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and had a lot of fun watching ALADDIN. Other than those at Disney, however, the only person around today capable of achieving a high standard for animated features is Don Bluth, the driving force behind AN AMERICAN TAIL.\nBut wait--don\&#39;t the ads for ONCE UPON A FOREST state that this film comes from &#34;the creator of AN AMERICAN TAIL&#34;? Yes, they do, but the man they\&#39;re referring to is David Kirschner, who served as executive producer for TAIL. Those going to this film expecting to see a Bluth-quality motion picture are in for a rude surprise, although it\&#39;s a mistake Twentieth Century Fox would like to see repeated over and over again.\nThe story is pathetically thin, even by the limited standards of an average five-year-old. Children will enjoy this movie the way they do Saturday morning cartoons, finding it mildly entertaining but nothing special (does that make it worth an admission price?). Mercifully, the running time is short, so parents accompanying their children won\&#39;t be bored to death.\nFor the most part, the animation isn\&#39;t worth mentioning. The characters move, but the background doesn\&#39;t, and there are only a few scenes where any real attention was paid to establishing some sort of mood (those include a venture into a construction site and an adventure involving a well-depicted owl).\nRemember last year\&#39;s disappointing FERN GULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST? Well, ONCE UPON A FOREST shares many of that movie\&#39;s traits, right down to the &#34;don\&#39;t destroy nature&#34; theme. However, while FERN GULLY could at least claim the asset of Robin Williams\&#39; vocal talents, ONCE UPON A FOREST is stuck. It has Ben Vereen, but his voice is used for maybe two minutes worth of screen time.\nThere\&#39;s not much else that I can say about ONCE UPON A FOREST. Lackluster productions like this aren\&#39;t worth additional words. The movie is dull and shows an obvious lack of innovation and creativity, but for those desperate to take their kids to a &#34;suitable&#34; movie, this one will fit the bill, although it might be better to wait a few weeks for the re-release of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES. If you go, however, remember this: it\&#39;s the adults, not the kids, who will have trouble sitting through the movie.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Mason Gamble, Walter Matthau, Joan Plowright, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Robert Stanton Director: Nick Castle Producers: John Hughes and Richard Vane Screenplay: John Hughes Music: Jerry Goldsmith Released by Warner Brothers Pictures\nIn 1951, a comic strip character by the name of Dennis Mitchell made his debut. Inked by Hank Ketcham, it didn\&#39;t take long for DENNIS THE MENACE to become a favorite. During the course of the next forty-two years, Dennis would be turned into a weekly television series, an animated program, and now, a major motion picture.\nAll the characters are present. There\&#39;s Dennis (Mason Gamble), the blond five-year old demon with a cowlick. Dennis\&#39; long-suffering mother Alice is capably played by Lea Thompson, and the venerable British actress Joan Plowright takes a turn as Mrs. Wilson. Perhaps the best bit of casting is the choice of Walter Matthau as Mr. Wilson, the grumpy neighbor who becomes the frequent target of Dennis\&#39; pranks.\nThrown into the group, with no apparent value other than to provide a HOME ALONE-type villain, is Christopher Lloyd\&#39;s Switchblade Sam, a homeless thief who roams the neighborhood stealing purses and breaking into houses. Sam\&#39;s inclusion is perhaps the movie\&#39;s biggest mistake since it takes the focus away from the more interesting Dennis/Mr. Wilson interaction by introducing an uninspired plot line that ends up resembling a poor man\&#39;s hack job of O. Henry\&#39;s &#34;The Ransom of Red Chief&#34;.\nThere are too many &#34;HOME ALONEisms&#34; in DENNIS THE MENACE. We don\&#39;t need to see Mr. Wilson fall prey to many of the same sorts of &#34;accidents&#34; that previously tormented Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. At least in the two HOME ALONE movies, the victims were bad guys. Here, while Mr. Wilson isn\&#39;t the most affable of neighbors, he certainly isn\&#39;t a villain, and is undeserving of the cruel treatment dished out to him. On the other hand, Switchblade Sam is a crook, so the only thing wrong with his getting a thorough plastering is that this part of the story (a little kid beating up on an unsuspecting and stupid criminal) has lost its spontaneity and appeal. Through blatant overuse, it has gotten old real quick.\nRecycling old formulas is, in fact, the big problem. Even setting aside the reuse of HOME ALONE material, there\&#39;s nothing original in this film. Certainly no one would claim anything to be distinctive about the &#34;buddy&#34; relationship that develops between Dennis and Mr. Wilson. Countless pictures have explored this theme, including the recent offerings COP AND AN HALF and LIFE WITH MIKEY. DENNIS THE MENACE has nothing to offer that those two didn\&#39;t, and that immediately puts it in pretty poor company.\nIn general, I didn\&#39;t find DENNIS THE MENACE particularly funny, although the kids in the audience enjoyed it. There\&#39;s nothing repugnant about the film. Like HOME ALONE, it\&#39;s a live-action cartoon. There are a few worthwhile moments, the best of which may be the one that goes on side-by- side with the closing credits. Almost all the scenes featuring Dennis and Mr. Wilson are entertaining (although the occasional attempts at pathos are out of place). Unfortunately, these are too few. Time is taken away from developing this relationship to allow the inclusion of the inane Christopher Lloyd subplot.\nPleasantly surprising is the likability of Mason Gamble\&#39;s Dennis. He isn\&#39;t the brat that the previews and ads portray him to be. Gamble\&#39;s cute performance becomes more endearing than obnoxious, combining the same mixture of innocence, enthusiasm, and vulnerability that made Macaulay Culkin a star. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Gamble\&#39;s child co- stars (Amy Sakasitz as Margaret and Kelly Hathaway as Joey). These two are so annoying that I was yearning for Dennis to plunk them both with slingshot-launched marbles.\nSome concern has been expressed about the image that Christopher Lloyd\&#39;s character presents of a homeless person. I contend that rather than giving a negative impression of the homeless, with which he is never clearly associated, Switchblade Sam will instead reinforce a lesson that is taught to children every day: don\&#39;t talk to strangers. I don\&#39;t see Sam doing any more to affect opinions on the homeless than Brenda Fricker\&#39;s amiable bag lady did in HOME ALONE 2.\nDENNIS THE MENACE is basically an innocuous movie. I think most children will get a kick out of it, and those adults roped into seeing it won\&#39;t find themselves yearning to escape through the nearest exit (as is unfortunately the case with too many &#34;family films&#34;). On the other hand, I wonder if DENNIS is worth the money. It isn\&#39;t that much better than a lot of the current fare on television, and won\&#39;t lose a whole lot in the translation from big screen to video. Basically, there\&#39;s nothing remarkable about this movie that demands for it to be seen. If you\&#39;re running low on films to take the family to, DENNIS THE MENACE will do. Otherwise, it might be prudent to spend the time (and money) on something of a little better quality.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: varies Running Length: 2:31 Rated: NR (Nudity, mature themes)\nStarring: Karen-Lise Mynster, Erland Josephson, Ghita Norby, Torben Zeller, Jesper Christensen Director: Liv Ullmann Producer: Lars Kolvig Screenplay: Liv Ullmann and Peter Poulson from the novel MENDEL PHILIPSEN &amp; SON by Henri Nathensen Music: various composers Released by Arrow Entertainment Danish with English Subtitles\nThe year is 1886 and although twenty-eight-year old Sofie (Karen-Lise Mynster) has been of marriageable age for a decade, she has yet to find a suitable match. Her parents Semmy (Erland Josephson) and Frederikke (Ghita Norby) want their only child to choose a cultured, educated Jew, but Sofie is searching for love and passion. She longs for the same kind of rich, affectionate bonding that her parents share. When Sofie falls for the painter Hojby (Jesper Christensen), Semmy and Frederikke become alarmed at the prospect of their daughter marrying a Gentile and decide to take action, condoning a marriage with the mournful Jonas (Torben Zeller). Sofie at first rejects the match but, in the face of mounting pressure from her family, she finds herself torn between passion and duty, and forced to reconsider her original decision.\nThose that see SOFIE will undoubtedly be struck by the similarities between this film and the work of Ingmar Bergman. Considering those involved in the project, this is not surprising. SOFIE marks the directorial debut of the internationally-recognized actress Liv Ullmann, who began working with Bergman in 1967\&#39;s HOUR OF THE WOLF. Also present is actor Erland Josephson, who worked on numerous Bergman efforts, including 1982\&#39;s much-lauded FANNY AND ALEXANDER.\nNevertheless, although SOFIE is a Bergman kind of story with Bergman-like characters, Liv Ullmann lacks Bergman\&#39;s mastery. This is in no way a slight on her, since there are few--if any--directors today who could claim to be on such a high plane. For a debut, this is an ambitious, if not entirely successful, effort.\nIt\&#39;s rare for any movie, whether domestic or foreign, to cast such a group of plain actors and actresses. Even though Sofie is repeatedly referred to as beautiful, Karen-Lise Mynster is far from ravishing (although to call her homely would be a stretch). The two male leads (Christensen and Zeller) are equally unremarkable. These casting choices, which in Hollywood would be considered disastrous, work because they give the audience a sense that the story unfolding is happening to real people.\nThe greatest flaw of SOFIE lies in its uneven pacing and choppy narrative style. The first two hours go by too slowly, often spending excessive time on minor issues while glossing over more important ones (the reasons for Sofie\&#39;s choice of a husband are almost entirely ignored, and the psychological struggle accompanying this decision is largely omitted). However, in the final thirty minutes, time accelerates greatly, and events go by too fast. Numerous interesting events occur during the last quarter of the film, but the opportunity is not there to savor them.\nAnother problem is the emotional distance between the audience and the characters. For whatever reason, Ullmann keeps Sofie at arm\&#39;s-length for most of the movie. Some of this is undoubtedly a byproduct of the pacing, but the script waits too long to express Sofie\&#39;s motivation and for much of the movie she seems to be a reactive--and rather dull--person. Additionally, while Ms. Mynster is a fine actress, she is significantly older than twenty-eight and, as a result, is somewhat difficult to accept during the early scenes when she portrays the young Sofie.\nOne recurrent theme that is handled expertly is the inflexibility of time. Once a decision is made, it cannot be undone, and things put off until tomorrow often never get accomplished. In an especially poignant scene, Sofie reflects on how she will soon be a grandmother holding a child in her lap when it seems that just yesterday she was a child sitting in her grandmother\&#39;s lap. Moments like these, although perhaps too far apart in this movie, recall Bergman at his best.\nTaken as a whole, SOFIE is an unhappy film, but some of what Ullmann has done with the story keeps it from being an unrelenting source of depression. The director shows that even in the most tragic of existences, there are moments of simple joy and triumph. Even as elements of Sofie\&#39;s life collapse around her, she finds things to cling to, most often her parents and her son. The simple, happy marriage of her mother and father presents a refreshing counterpoint to her own unhappy relationship with her husband.\nBeyond the plodding pace of SOFIE, there\&#39;s a great deal of worthwhile material. Although the movie varies from dull to riveting, the acting is constant throughout. This is not a film for the &#34;average&#34; movie-goer, but for those who like character-driven stories that focus on the friction between generations, SOFIE is a worthy entry. It may lack many of the subtle touches of an Ingmar Bergman film, but it\&#39;s unmistakable at whose hands Liv Ullmann learned her newest trade.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: varies Running Length: 1:45 Rated: NR (Mature themes)\nStarring: Daniel Auteuil, Emmanuelle Beart, Andre Dussollier, Elisabeth Bourgine Director: Claude Sautet Producers: Jean-Louis Livi and Philippe Carcassonne Screenplay: Yves Ulmann, Jacques Fieschi, and Jerome Tonnere Music: Maurice Ravel Released by October Films French with English Subtitles\nStephane (Daniel Auteuil) and Maxime (Andre Dussollier) share a friendship the closeness of which is unusual between employee and employer. Stephane works for Maxime at an exclusive Paris violin repair shop. One evening, when the two are at dinner, Maxime announces that he has fallen in love with a new client, Camille Kessler (Emmanuelle Beart). The affair is so serious that Maxime has left his wife and intends to move in with Camille. Upon meeting his friend\&#39;s new lover, Stephane is immediately intrigued, and the reaction is certainly mutual. It doesn\&#39;t take long for the feelings between the two to grow, and their contact, while infrequent, becomes increasingly intimate. Yet even as Stephane fights to maintain his own emotional equilibrium, for the first time in her life, Camille loses hers, and her simple attraction to Stephane becomes an obsession.\nOften foreign films, and French films in particular, are thought of by the average movie-goer as being exceptionally (and some would say &#34;overly&#34;) intellectual. This could not be more true than for UN COEUR EN HIVER, yet it is not merely the mind that this film touches. The rich musical score (Ravel) is a feast for the ears, and the exceptional performances of the principals leads to several emotionally-potent moments. UN COEUR EN HIVER is one of those rare films that can be described as completely satisfying.\nDistilled to its basic essence, the movie is a story that the French do so well: the romantic triangle. Beyond the premise, however, there is nothing ordinary about UN COEUR EN HIVER. From the point where Stephane and Camille meet, much of what happens goes contrary to expectations. Theirs is definitely not a typical tale of clandestine love. Rather, it is an examination of the prices of emotional honesty and emotional isolation.\nOddly enough, it\&#39;s Stephane, the character with the most screen time (and the man whose heart is &#34;in winter&#34;) who remains much the enigma to the audience. Even though we come to identify with him, and understand some of what he does, the depth of his emotions often remains unclear. The last scene of the movie explicitly reveals part of the truth, but for much about Stephane, the viewer must reach his or her own conclusions.\nDaniel Auteuil plays his role with ability. His is a difficult performance to make succeed, given the ambiguity surrounding Stephane, but Auteuil has found the perfect balance. At times it becomes difficult to determine whether Stephane should be pitied or vilified, and it is to Auteuil\&#39;s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty.\nCamille is no less a complicated character, but her feelings are simpler to read. She hides nothing, and when she recognizes that she loves Stephane, there is no doubt in her mind--or ours--of the truth. Especially noteworthy is the way that Camille\&#39;s sudden, intense passion for Stephane intertwines, and at times conflicts with her lifelong love of music.\nEmmanuelle Beart gives an astonishing, unaffected performance. Emotion is often displayed in the most subtle and easy-to-miss gestures, expressions, and vocal inflections. Before beginning production of UN COEUR EN HIVER, Beart had never played the violin. After the film\&#39;s release in France, director Claude Sautet claimed that she &#34;fooled everyone&#34; with her &#34;perfect motions&#34; (violinist Jean-Jacques Kantorow does the actual playing). Not only are her hand movements accomplished, but the look of rapture on her face as she loses herself in the music of Ravel is a clear example of how fully Ms. Beart allowed the personae of Camille to enfold her.\nBeart explained the importance of coming to understand music as integral to defining Camille: &#34;[Director] Claude [Sautet] told me from the beginning, \&#39;I will only ask one thing of you; play the violin. The day you can play the violin, you will be Camille. There is nothing more I can tell you about the character.\&#39;&#34; Indeed, it is the importance of music to Camille that puts every other emotion in the film, whether displayed by her or by others, into perspective.\nUN COEUR EN HIVER is yet another case of real-life chemistry translating well to the screen. Beart and Auteuil are companions away from their acting, and the spark of this intensity, even unfulfilled as it is here, is too obvious to miss.\nWith the exceptions of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and SOMMERSBY, there have been no 1993 releases to equal the power of UN COEUR EN HIVER. Strong characters, intelligent writing, and exquisite performances combine to draw the audience into the movie. Mental and emotional participation are demanded. This is a movie with deep, churning currents. Those who are attracted only to Hollywood\&#39;s shallow waters may find UN COEUR EN HIVER too intimidating, but anyone who enjoys a more complex cinematic experience will find as much as they could hope for in this picture.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Eight-year old Jonah Baldwin (Ross Malinger) misses his mother, who died eighteen months ago from cancer. More than that, however, he recognizes that his father Sam (Tom Hanks) is desperately lonely. So, on Christmas Eve, Jonah calls up a radio talk-show psychologist and asks for help. Forced onto the phone by his son and identified as &#34;Sleepless in Seattle,&#34; Sam reluctantly (at first) opens up and talks about his love for his dead wife and the things that made her special. Across the country in Baltimore, Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) is listening to the syndicated program, and Sam\&#39;s testimonial of love brings tears to her eyes. Even though she is engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman), Annie begins to wonder what it would be like to meet Sam, even going so far as to be one of thousands to write a letter to him. But when circumstances conspire to make an assignation possible, the question is whether either Sam or Annie will have the courage to follow the signs that fate has shown to them.\nThere are those who will claim that SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is too corny, with sugar-coated cuteness filling in for the lack of a strong plot. And, while they have a point, there\&#39;s something that the cynics are missing--it\&#39;s meant to be that way. By its own admission, this film is intended to be a throwback to the screen romances of the past (AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER in particular, which is cited numerous times, and borrowed from explicitly and implicitly). Anyone going to see SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE expecting a tale of stark modern life has walked into the wrong theater. This is a timeless, dreamy fantasy whose mood falls somewhere between magic and reality.\nCoincidence is the backbone of Nora Ephron\&#39;s story, wending its way through the plot with uncanny repetitiveness. Skillfully, however, the script turns to its advantage what could have been a major hindrance to the audience\&#39;s suspension of disbelief. The concept of destiny is an important element to all that transpires. At the beginning of the film, Annie is a realist who dismisses the idea of a supernatural sign as nothing more than a random occurrence. By the end of SLEEPLESS, she has become a firm believer in fate. Considering the unusual nature of the bond she develops with Sam, how could she not?\nWhile this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, especially amidst the burgeoning tide of action/adventure summer fare, it is not without flaws. The character of Walter, although nicely played by Bill Pullman, is superfluous. His inclusion is meant to say something about Annie\&#39;s life and personality but, as the movie progresses, he becomes more of a hindrance and annoyance than an asset. His purpose is never clearly delineated and the too-neat resolution of this subplot is lacking in believability.\nThen there\&#39;s Annie\&#39;s family. The dinner scene with them near the beginning of the movie is pointless, with the attempts at humor coming across as weak and unfunny. Little of value is revealed about any character. Apparently what we\&#39;re supposed to learn is how quirky Annie\&#39;s relatives are and how this has impacted on her personality, but the way the scene is played, the result is only partially achieved. It\&#39;s not that this part of the movie is unpleasant, but it doesn\&#39;t seem to belong, and the cutting-room floor might have been a more appropriate place for it to reside.\nThe ending is a little abrupt, but not in a bad sense. It\&#39;s usually a positive trait of a film to keep the audience hungry at the conclusion. We want to see a little more--perhaps just a crumb to nibble on--even though it\&#39;s clear that the story has reached its natural conclusion. More often than not, as is the case in SLEEPLESS, this is an indication that the characters have been well-defined and deftly portrayed.\nTom Hanks, who is frequently chosen for parts that demand energy and verve, does an excellent job in a subdued role. It\&#39;s easy enough to make the widower into a cliche, but Mr. Hanks\&#39; heartfelt performance, combined with an intelligent script, have avoided that. Instead of a person lifted from stock, we are given a man we can accept and whose grief we can sympathize with.\nMeg Ryan has a less challenging role and, compared to what she did in PRELUDE TO A KISS (where she had to play the old man in a young woman\&#39;s body), there\&#39;s nothing noteworthy about what she does. She\&#39;s a likable actress who is fine for the part, but she has far fewer &#34;moments&#34; than Mr. Hanks.\nThe supporting actors are effective. Rosie O\&#39;Donnell and newcomer Ross Malinger manage to steal their share of scenes. Bill Pullman, despite being saddled with a poorly-developed character, manages to make an impression (sort of like in NEWSIES). Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks\&#39; real-life wife) have small parts.\nSLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has been billed as a &#34;romantic comedy,&#34; but the accent is more on romance than humor. Comic moments are kept to a minimum, and there are only a couple of openly funny scenes (one involves a comparison of &#34;male&#34; and &#34;female&#34; movies--AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER versus THE DIRTY DOZEN). Subtle humor abounds, but it\&#39;s the kind that normal people encounter in everyday life, more often worthy of a chuckle than outright laughter.\nAs an antidote to the summer doldrums and an alternative to dinosaurs, rock-climbing, and last action heroes, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is perfect. While lacking the unfettered charm and exuberance of Kenneth Branagh\&#39;s MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, this film is enjoyable in its own right, not to mention more easily accessible. Lovers will probably enjoy this a fraction better than singles, but there\&#39;s more than enough in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE to cause the edges of just about everyone\&#39;s lips to curl upwards.\nOh, one more gripe. Brooks Robinson, while unquestionably a great baseball player, is not (as this film claims) the lone choice for best third baseman of all time. Of equal, if not greater, stature is a man by the name of Mike Schmidt.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: 6/30/93 Running Length: 2:34 Rated: R (Language, mature themes, sexual situations, violence)\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Gene Hackman, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, Wilford Brimley Director: Sydney Pollack Producers: Scott Rudin, John Davis, and Syndey Pollack Screenplay: David Rabe, Robert Towne, and David Rayfiel based on the book by John Grisham Music: Dave Grusin Released by Paramount Pictures\nMitchell Y. McDeere (Tom Cruise) has just graduated in the top five of his class from Harvard Law School. With a record like his, there are understandably a lot of people interested in employing him. Offers abound from the large, the prestigious, and the desirable, but eventually it\&#39;s a small firm from Memphis that snares Mitch\&#39;s services. Bendini, Lambert, and Locke make the terms of his joining them so enticing that the deal is impossible to turn down--a starting salary near $100,000, a low-interest mortgage so he can buy a house, free use of a Mercedes, and repayment of his college loans. At first, Mitch and his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) eagerly celebrate their new life and home, but it doesn\&#39;t take long for the euphoria to wear thin. Two members of the Firm die under suspicious circumstances and soon Mitch begins to wonder what secrets lie behind the locked doors of Bendini, Lambert, and Locke.\nJohn Grisham\&#39;s novel THE FIRM is a furious page-turner, the kind of book that you don\&#39;t want to put down once you\&#39;ve started reading it. The characters are well-rounded and developed in such a way that the reader cares about their fates. The fascinating setup (roughly the first 100 pages) is perhaps the novel\&#39;s greatest strength and, even though the eventual resolution lacks punch, few would deny that THE FIRM is an entertaining read.\nSydney Pollack\&#39;s film THE FIRM is the kind of movie that almost anyone could walk out on without feeling that they\&#39;ve missed much, regardless of whether they\&#39;ve read the book or not. Very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has made it to the screen and what we\&#39;re left with instead is an overly-long (two hours and thirty-four minutes, to be exact), pedantic thriller that, at best, can be described as average.\nThe producer/director has been quoted as saying that he wants his movie to stand on its own, apart from the book. That\&#39;s a good idea, because the film THE FIRM doesn\&#39;t come close to reaching the level of intensity achieved by the novel of the same name. Comparisons are inevitable, of course, but it isn\&#39;t necessary to have read the written version to be disappointed by the visual adaptation.\nThe plot is a good place to start the discussion. This was the book\&#39;s weakest element and, if anything, it\&#39;s worse in the movie. While the final &#34;twist&#34; to the movie\&#39;s story (which in no way resembles what happens in the novel) is clever, it is also difficult to accept. Let\&#39;s not forget the forces that Mitch is up against. Is it reasonable to believe everything that happens in the pivotal climactic scenes? I doubt it. While I applaud the screenwriters for coming up with a unique way to conclude the film, their inept execution of the concept causes the ending to seem cheap and contrived.\nThe unfortunate tone of the movie is set during the first hour. The film spends quite a bit of time using short, often-disjointed scenes in an attempt to recapture the near-perfect mood of Grisham\&#39;s setup. This would have worked nicely if those various snippets had successfully conveyed the allure of the Firm to Mitch and Abby, but things rush by so quickly and everything is so out-of-sync that the result is to make the first quarter of the movie long and tedious.\nThere are many differences between motion picture and novel. With numerous expected, mostly-minor cuts and changes, the first half of the film stays reasonably close to its written counterpart. After that, however, the differences become progressively larger until only the names of the characters and certain general events remain the same. Not all of the changes are bad--some, at least in their intent, are intriguing. Unfortunately, the script writers appear not to have thought things through all the way--a fault that Grisham\&#39;s novel is rarely guilty of.\nOn the surface, Tom Cruise and Jeanne Tripplehorn might seem like acceptable choices to play the roles of Mitch and Abby McDeere. That is, until they start to &#34;act&#34;. Cruise has at times been good in front of the camera (in pictures such as BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY), while in other instances he has done little more than show off his good looks (DAYS OF THUNDER). In the case of THE FIRM, which demands range and ability, the star falls solidly in the second category. Not until the last act does he give anything resembling a feeling performance, managing to effectively sabotage Mitch in the process. By the time things get interesting in THE FIRM, we don\&#39;t care what happens to the protagonist, because the actor playing him has failed to capture our sympathy.\nJeanne Tripplehorn is worse, playing Abby with as much enthusiasm and energy as a zombie. Even as I was apathetic towards Mitch because of Cruise, I began to actively dislike Abby as a result of Tripplehorn\&#39;s unimaginative performance. Consider for a moment someone of Emma Thompson\&#39;s caliber in this part and you\&#39;ll want to break into tears of frustration.\nFortunately for the film, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Especially worthy of mention are Ed Harris as FBI agent Tarrance and Wilford Brimley as De Vasher, the Firm\&#39;s security strong man. Both of these actors steal many of the scenes that they\&#39;re in.\nAs impressive as these two, if not more so, is Gene Hackman\&#39;s Avery Tolar. Softened in the movie from his counterpart in the book, this Avery becomes the only completely real--and sympathetic--character in the film. Hackman\&#39;s performance is more than half the reason why. In the hands of a lesser actor, Avery could have become sappy, silly, or stupid, but not in this case. By the closing scenes of THE FIRM, he was the only one I really cared about.\nI dislike bashing movies simply because they differ from the books that spawned them. The mediums of entertainment are different, after all, and should be treated as such. No film can do a perfect adaptation of a novel. In the case of THE FIRM, however, the problems have little to do with the changes made to the story. Putting aside the issue of its source, this is not a good movie. If there\&#39;s a reason to go, and I don\&#39;t think there is, it\&#39;s to see Gene Hackman\&#39;s performance. Unfortunately, given his amount of screen time, there\&#39;s a lot of other garbage that will have to be endured along the way.\nIn the past, I\&#39;ve enjoyed many of Syndey Pollack\&#39;s projects (OUT OF AFRICA and TOOTSIE in particular), but this film got derailed early and even this talented director proved unable to get it back on course. I suppose it\&#39;s a difficult task to try to please both admirers of the novel and the casual movie-goer who has never read it. In attempting that, Pollack has made a mess of everything--plot, characterization, and pacing. Even the music, by Dave Grusin, is inappropriate.\nFans of John Grisham\&#39;s novel will see THE FIRM regardless of what reviews it gets, so to them, and to others, I offer a cautionary warning to be wary. THE FIRM had a lot of potential but the production team found numerous ways to mess it up. This isn\&#39;t an awful film, nor is it unwatchable, but I\&#39;d think twice before spending time and money in a darkened theater with telling of Mitch McDeere\&#39;s struggles.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: 6/25/93 Running Length: 1:33 Rated: PG-13 (Brief nudity)\nStarring: Tilda Swinton, Charlotte Valandrey, Lothaire Bluteau, Quentin Crisp, Billy Zane Director: Sally Potter Producer: Christopher Sheppard Screenplay: Sally Potter from the novel by Virginia Woolf Music: David Motion and Sally Potter Released by Sony Pictures Classics\nThe year is 1600 and the country is England. Orlando (Tilda Swinton) is a young nobleman who has found favor with Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp). As a result of his relationship as the &#34;son&#34; of her old age, Orlando is granted the deed to a sizable piece of property. Ten years later, following the death of his father, Orlando falls in love with a beautiful Russian princess (Charlotte Valandrey). After that relationship ends in tragedy, and following a brief-but-disastrous flirtation with poetry, Orlando becomes an ambassador to central Asia. It is now the 18th century and Orlando has lived more than one-hundred years without showing a day\&#39;s aging. But the most remarkable event of his life--his sudden and unexpected transformation into a woman--is yet to come.\nORLANDO is a movie thin on story but thick on elegance and style. Characters and settings, as well as a brief-but-lavish tour through 400 years of history, take precedence over plot. Even on its own terms, the storyline of this film is weak and riddled with contrivances, questions, and problems. Writer Sally Potter, adapting from Virginia Woolf\&#39;s novel, takes the approach that the narrative is essentially irrelevant. Its purpose is to allow explorations of Orlando as he/she develops over the years, and of the ever-changing attitudes of society.\nThose that want a detailed examination of how a person copes with unusual longevity won\&#39;t find it here. In fact, other than a throw-away line by Queen Elizabeth (in which she bestows land upon Orlando under the condition that he not grow old and wrinkled like her), there is no explanation given for why the title character neither ages nor dies. This is taken as a given; one of the many plot points glossed over.\nAnother thing that is more-or-less ignored is the mechanism by which Orlando changes sex. After a long sleep following a battle in which he refuses to kill, Orlando wakes up one morning as a woman. Her reaction is simple--&#34;Same person ... different sex&#34; and she evidences little or no surprise at the sudden and unexpected transformation.\nLittle issue is made of how other characters react to Orlando\&#39;s femaleness. With the exception of Archduke Harry (John Wood), no one makes a big deal out of it, although the English courts remove Orlando\&#39;s property since a woman cannot legally inherit land. As one man comments when the Victorian courts can\&#39;t determine whether Orlando is dead or a woman, &#34;They\&#39;re pretty much the same thing.&#34;\nOne constant source of interest in ORLANDO is watching how English society and customs change over the centuries. After Orlando\&#39;s transformation, it\&#39;s fascinating to watch the size of her gown as it shrinks from its mammoth proportions of the 1700s to the more &#34;natural&#34; garb of the present day. This is only a subtle indication of how women come to be regarded more as people than property.\nOther than Orlando, there is no character that is around for more than about 15 or 20 minutes. Billy Zane, who plays the American adventurer Shelmerdine, shares billing with lead actress Tilda Swinton, but is on-screen for only a handful of scenes. The same is true of all the other co-stars.\nSwinton gives a masterful performance, displaying amazing range as both a man and a woman. Even though her decidedly-feminine appearance hurts the audience\&#39;s ability to accept Orlando as a man, the manner in which Swinton speaks and acts during that part of the film are masculine. She is more believable after the transformation, but that\&#39;s mainly because her looks now match her mannerisms.\nSharing the opposite-gender playing with Tilda Swinton is actor Quentin Crisp, who plays Queen Elizabeth I. There\&#39;s no difficulty accepting Crisp as the wrinkled old queen. Perhaps this, in addition to other recent males-playing-females, indicate that, given the right physical appearance, it\&#39;s easier to make up a man like a woman than the other way around.\nThose that go to ORLANDO expecting a tightly-constructed plot will leave with deflated expectations. The power of this movie is far removed from any of the many contrivances centered around the emaciated storyline. See ORLANDO for its fabulous costumes, fascinating look at changing eras, and impressive performance by Tilda Swinton. Viewing this film for other reasons will almost certainly lead to a negative impression.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: varies Running Length: 2:00 Rated: NR (Sex, nudity, violence, mature themes)\nStarring: Misa Shimizu, Takehiro Murata, Takeo Nakahara Director: Takehiro Nakajima Producer: Takehiro Nakajima Screenplay: Takehiro Nakajima Music: Hiroshi Ariyoshi Released by Cinevista Japanese with English Subtitles\n&#34;Okoge&#34; is a Japanese word that describes the crust of burned rice left in the bottom of a rice cooker. In recent years, it has also come to be used as a pejorative term for a woman who likes to hang around with gay men. In Takehiro Nakajima\&#39;s film OKOGE, Sayoko (Misa Shimizu) is such a person. She is obviously both curious about the gay lifestyle and free of the homophobic sentiments which permeate Japanese society. She meets Goh (Takehiro Murata) and his older lover Tochi (Takeo Nakahara) at a gay beach and is so touched by their open affection that she seeks out the pair and offers the use of her apartment when they can\&#39;t find a place to go to be alone. It isn\&#39;t long before a close friendship develops among the trio, and Sayoko becomes as much involved in the lives of Goh and Tochi as they do in hers.\nFirst and foremost, OKOGE is an examination of the difficulties faced by gay men in a society as conservative and restrictive as that in Japan. Actually, many of the themes of the movie, as well as the problems encountered by the main characters, have universal implications. Switch things around a little and this tale could easily occur in the United States. Perhaps it takes a film from a different country to bring into perspective one of America\&#39;s more ugly hypocrisies: the supposedly &#34;free and open&#34; society run by people with closed minds.\nToo often, one of the problems with movies involving homosexual themes and issues is a tendency to sermonize. Both THE LIVING END and CLAIRE OF THE MOON were guilty of this. Instead of letting the characters and story bring the message to the fore, each of those films felt it necessary to preach about the evils of a homophobic society. For the most part, OKOGE avoids this pitfall. There are a few scenes that are too obviously scripted (such as one in which a bunch of gay men sit around debating whether their sexual preference is the result of genetics or environment), but the movie generally allows the natural flow of its plot to explore issues, rather than relying on unconvincing contrivances.\nOKOGE also has a sense of humor. Not a deadly-serious movie, this is instead a picture that is unafraid to let the audience laugh. Most of the jokes are at the expense of the homophobes in the film, and they are crafted skillfully enough to get the point across--and be funny--without becoming condescending.\nNevertheless, all is far-from-perfect with OKOGE. Instead of being a cohesive whole, it\&#39;s more like two films, each very different in quality and tone from the other. The only constant is the characters.\nThe first seventy-five minutes of OKOGE is a skillfully-done character study, focusing on the unusual menage a trois that exists between Sayoko, Goh, and Tochi. All three characters are skillfully-realized and well-developed, and the situations they find themselves in are believable. Then something happens to break one side of the triangle.\nFrom that moment on, OKOGE is never the same. It begins to wander aimlessly, stumbling along as if unsure exactly where it wants to go. Sayoko has an affair with a soldier, the reasons for which are left murky and uncertain. Goh tries a heterosexual experiment that ends in disaster, and Tochi disappears altogether for a while. There is a sudden jump of about two years\&#39; time (which is left completely unexplained by the movie--it takes about thirty seconds to figure out what has happened), and everyone\&#39;s circumstances have changed. The film takes its last twenty minutes to resolve the various messes that the main trio have gotten themselves into.\nAlthough a little on the sweet side, the ending is nicely-done, showing that love and sex don\&#39;t have to be two sides to the same coin, but there\&#39;s nearly forty minutes of confusion between the excellent beginning of OKOGE and its conclusion.\nI\&#39;ve never before seen Japanese actress Misa Shimizu, but her performance in this film is an eye-opener. She puts an incredible amount of energy into her performance. I\&#39;m not sure how the character was written, but Shimizu\&#39;s rendering of Sayoko positively sparkles. The two male leads aren\&#39;t quite as good, but neither Murata nor Nakahara does a bad job.\nOKOGE may not be an ideal movie, but it goes a long way towards removing the bad taste left behind by such heavy-handed efforts as THE LIVING END and CLAIRE OF THE MOON. Not only does it give an intelligent, sympathetic portrayal of the difficulties of a gay lifestyle, but it presents them from a woman\&#39;s point-of-view. Credit should be given to Takehiro Nakajima for daring to make this film in a country with such a rigid social structure. The strengths of OKOGE certainly outweigh the weaknesses.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Henry Rowengartner (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a poor Little League player who can throw strikes (not very hard), but has trouble catching the ball. Then one day, while trying to impress a girl at school, he has an accident trying to prove that he doesn\&#39;t drop every fly that comes his way. His arm ends up in a cast for most of the summer, but when the doctor finally takes it off, Henry discovers a remarkable thing. Because of &#34;tight tendons&#34; in his right arm, he can somehow throw a ball in excess of 100 miles per hour. It doesn\&#39;t take long for the Cubs to give the twelve-year-old a tryout, then sign him up (how desperate is this team?) It\&#39;s a move that pays off because, after a rocky debut, Henry becomes the catalyst that leads the team into a Pennant Race.\nBefore I do the written equivalent of tearing this film into shreds and dumping the remains where they belong, I\&#39;ll be honest enough to admit that boys around the age of ten seemed to enjoy ROOKIE OF THE YEAR very much. The movie is clean enough to be considered a family film, although I doubt many of the bored girls and disinterested parents in the audience would endorse it. Personally, I think that family films should be enjoyable for everyone in the family, not just a select sex/age group. There are movies available that meet this criteria (ALADDIN, THE SANDLOT, and A FAR OFF PLACE, to name a few). Unfortunately, their number is dwindling as they are replaced with dim-witted, poorly-conceived dross like this picture.\nAs the title suggests, ROOKIE OF THE YEAR aspires to be a baseball movie. In this, it fails in almost every respect. Fans of the game will be horrified by the lack of attention paid to the nuances and subtleties of baseball, while those who don\&#39;t like &#34;America\&#39;s pastime&#34; will probably find this film uninspiring, unimaginative, and uninteresting (all of which it certainly is).\nA gargantuan misstep is that ROOKIE OF THE YEAR tries a few stabs at drama while its outrageous setup allows only for the most absurd of comedies. Maybe the Monty Python troupe could have done something with the premise, but it\&#39;s way beyond Daniel Stern\&#39;s meager abilities. As an actor, Stern has a flair for comedy (as showcased in HOME ALONE and CITY SLICKERS), but as a director (at least from the evidence we\&#39;re given here), he is inept. Unfortunately, as far as this movie is concerned, Daniel the actor doesn\&#39;t do much better than Daniel the director. His character, that of a wacky pitching coached who got beaned once too often, is easily the most potentially-amusing member of the Cubs, but Stern tries too hard for laughs and ends up getting little more than grimaces.\nThis movie is bad even as a fantasy for Cubs lovers and Mets haters. There\&#39;s not enough substance here to give meaning to the &#34;big game&#34; between the two clubs. Added to that, the Mets are portrayed as such a ridiculously over-the-top gang of thugs and losers that it\&#39;s impossible to hate them. Besides, given the team\&#39;s current woeful brand of real baseball, setting this team up as the heavy is a huge mistake. No one despises New York\&#39;s National League team any more (except perhaps their own fans)--they\&#39;re too woeful for that.\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR presents a perfect opportunity for a line of cameos by current and ex-Major League players. However, with the exception of fleeting glances of Bobby Bonilla, Pedro Guererro, and Barry Bonds (in a Pirates uniform--oops), there\&#39;s nothing. No members of the real Cubs are around, and play-by-play announcer Harry Carry is conspicuous by his absence. Personally, I can\&#39;t stand the man, but in a film so indulgent of Wrigley Field fantasies, the omission of Carry is profoundly felt. Instead, all we get is an embarrassingly silly John Candy doing his best Harry imitation--and a pale one it is, at that.\nThis is a genuinely insulting movie. It takes every formula and cliche and binds them together into a package that doesn\&#39;t work. Things might have been better if the director and screenwriter had shown a hint of aptitude, but nothing like that is forthcoming. Most baseball films, even the best of them, are formula-driven. Robert Redford hitting a home run in the bottom of the ninth is pure fantasy, not to mention absolutely predictable, but it\&#39;s still a great movie moment. ROOKIE OF THE YEAR lacks this kind of style, and its comedy is so daft that it can\&#39;t compete with the likes of MAJOR LEAGUE (which was, at best, a mediocre film).\nOf course, the characters are stock, and the actors aren\&#39;t able to do anything with them. Amy Morton, playing Henry\&#39;s mom, overacts outrageously. Thomas Ian Nicholas, in the title role, manages to make his character as annoying and unpleasant as possible. I\&#39;m sure I\&#39;m not the only one who wished someone would plunk that kid when he was dancing off first base and making fun of the Dodgers\&#39; pitcher.\nOutperforming every one is Gary Busey, but his is a thankless job. He puts an effort into bringing to the surface several facets of what is essentially a two-dimensional character, but there\&#39;s not much that Busey can do to save Chet Steadman. However, a purpose served by the presence of Busey is to give a yardstick by which the lackluster performances of the rest of the cast can be measured. Opposite him, none of them look good.\nIf you\&#39;re a ten-year-old boy who wants to vicariously live out the fantasy of playing for a big-league ball club, this might be a movie worth seeing, but for anyone else, it represents a blunder as big as a hanging curve ball. In baseball, you get three strikes and you\&#39;re out, but in the making of ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, Daniel Stern has gotten far more than that. Nearly the only good thing about this film is that I saw it in an air-conditioned theater on a day when the thermometer had nudged above the 100 degree mark. Nevertheless, half-way through the movie, the heat outside was starting to look good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Dead man seen dancing in a Congo line, picking up date for the rest of the night, and fighting with her overmuscled boyfriend. Film at eleven.\nThe original WEEKEND AT BERNIE\&#39;S is an incredibly stupid film with enough off-color, macabre physical comedy to generate some laughs. It\&#39;s a perfect VCR film--little or no attention is required to the plot, you can walk out of the room and come back in without missing anything, and the reduction of the picture to television size does nothing to hurt the film. It\&#39;s not intuitive to expect a sequel to this brainless movie, but the original WEEKEND did surprisingly well at the box-office. Add to that the results from a big video market and a second installment became in inevitability.\nPart two, helmed by Robert Klane, the man behind the previous effort, starts off basically where part one ends. Bernie (Terry Kiser), murdered in the original film, is now in the morgue. The two idiots (Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman) who dragged his body around through the original discover the key to a safety deposit box in his personal effects. This starts them on a treasure hunt for the missing two million dollars that Bernie embezzled from the company. Also along for the ride is Hummel (Barry Bostwick), the company\&#39;s sneering head-of-security, who needs to find the money to save his job. Then there\&#39;s a third group, working for some unnamed criminals, and using voodoo to animate Bernie\&#39;s dead corpse so that it will lead them to the cash.\nLike HOME ALONE 2, WEEKEND AT BERNIE\&#39;S 2 is pretty much a re-hash of the first movie. You get just about what you expect--two morons dragging around a dead body (that they use deodorant to &#34;freshen up&#34;) that everyone mistakes as being alive. There\&#39;s a girl who spends a night on the beach with Bernie (no sex--not even this movie is that off-color) and claims it was the most enjoyable time she\&#39;s had in a while. Of course, the corpse also gets viciously abused in every manner possible, without ever showing a scratch. In addition to repeats of what happened in WEEKEND 1, the body gets stuffed in a suitcase, jammed into a refrigerator, and shot through the head with an arrow.\nIn this movie, the body can move, thanks to a voodoo ceremony involving a pigeon (replacing a chicken that ran away--smart move on the chicken\&#39;s part). We\&#39;re treated to numerous scenes in which a herky-jerky Bernie dances to whatever tune is playing nearby. However, when the music stops, the body collapses like a marionette with its strings cut.\nAs was true in WEEKEND 1, the best performance is turned in by Terry Kiser as the corpse. That certainly isn\&#39;t an endorsement of the abilities of the rest of the cast, but it\&#39;s a true statement. Kiser\&#39;s sense for physical comedy is good, and he manages to infuse this otherwise worthless movie with enough energy to keep it out of the bottom rung of 1993 films.\nWEEKEND AT BERNIE\&#39;S 2 is made for a certain audience--the indiscriminate movie-goer who will see almost anything that guarantees a few laughs. Those that belong to that group will find what they\&#39;re looking for in this film. Almost all the humor is macabre and repetitive, but the film manages to be sporadically funny. Nevertheless, I find it hard to believe that many people will pay $6 or $7 to see a picture that has TV sitcom production values, writing, and acting.\nFor those who like movies in which corpses get knocked around and banged up, yet still manage to be more engaging than the living people around them, this film will not disappoint. Also, fans of the original WEEKEND AT BERNIE\&#39;S will probably be satisfied by this latest (and hopefully last) installment. Everyone else, especially those who restrict their film diet to &#34;good&#34; movies, should stay away (not that many of them would have considered going in the first place).\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: varies Running Length: 1:40 Rated: NR (Nothing offensive)\nStarring: Anders Danielson Lie, Frank Robert, Elisabeth Sand, Bjorn Floberg Director: Erik Gustavson Producer: Petter J. Borgli Screenplay: Lars Saabye Christensen Music: Randall Meyers Released by RKO Pictures Norwegian with English Subtitles\nHerman (Anders Danielson Lie) is not that much different from most 11-year old boys, but he\&#39;s unusual enough to earn him the taunts of his classmates and the scorn of his teachers. Counterbalancing his difficulties at school, however, is a warm home life. His parents (Elisabeth Sand and Bjorn Floberg) are both caring people who always make time in their busy lives for their son. Herman\&#39;s grandfather (Frank Robert), an aging man with a kind heart and an engaging disposition, becomes to his grandson more of a friend than a relative. However, Herman\&#39;s life is about to take a turn for the worse. After visiting the barber one day, he discovers that he has alopecia areata, a skin disease that, while not fatal or dangerous, will cause him to lose all of his hair.\nHERMAN is a lugubrious film about a relatively uninteresting subject: the tribulations of a young boy who is going bald. Admittedly, with a script infused with lively wit or emotionally- wrenching pathos, it is possible to make a coming-of-age story entertaining. HERMAN, however, takes neither of these roads, instead opting for a relatively-straightforward telling of the tale. The instances of humor, while occasionally amusing, are easily telegraphed, and there\&#39;s very little in the film to form an emotional link between the title character and the audience.\nGoing bald is likely to be a traumatic event for someone just out of his first decade of life, but the lack of any palpable threat to Herman\&#39;s health makes it difficult to feel for him. He becomes so morose and despondent about losing his hair that we begin to view him more as a whiner than someone undergoing a difficult time. At least at first, Herman definitely does not confront his disease heroically.\nThe film really doesn\&#39;t go anywhere. Often, it\&#39;s difficult to gain an understanding of what HERMAN\&#39;s real goal is. Overall, I suppose it\&#39;s trying to give us a picture of a young boy who isn\&#39;t afraid to be unusual, and who eventually overcomes his problems through that sense of individuality, but it\&#39;s a message that takes too long to get across. This is not an involving movie. It\&#39;s not bad--there are enough quirks of character to assure that--but neither is it good.\nFor those who like straightforward villains, a few of the kids in Herman\&#39;s class fit the bill nicely. They do all the things that bullies do to smaller children--make fun of them, intimidate them, and steal their things. Only one fellow classmate, a lively redheaded girl named Ruby, shows any friendship for Herman. In the end, she plays a part in his &#34;salvation,&#34; while all the bad kids are punished. This whole part of the story is fairly trivial.\nAlthough HERMAN attempts to be another MY LIFE AS A DOG, it doesn\&#39;t come close. That film had an emotional impact. We were drawn into the on-screen lives of the characters. HERMAN keeps us too much at a distance. There are a few moments of genuine insight, but nothing lasting. In the end, instead of an emotionally-vibrant motion picture experience, this movie turns out to be something of a dud.\n&#39;,
 &#39;In 1963, Frank Horrigan was among the &#34;best and brightest&#34; of the Secret Service, the personal choice of President Kennedy. On November 22 in Dallas, an afternoon that Horrigan will never forget, he became one of the few living agents to lose a president. Now, decades later and only months before a presidential election (perhaps 1992 or 1996--we\&#39;re never told exactly), Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) is stalking the President. Believing there to be an intangible bond between himself and Horrigan (he says they were both betrayed by a government they had once loved), Leary makes contact with the Secret Service agent to discuss his intentions. After his contact with the potential killer, Horrigan acts quickly to get himself posted to protection duty. This time, he has no intention of failing and believes that, given the opportunity, he will take the bullet. But Leary has everything on his side--time, opportunity, and a group of pig-headed behind-the-scenes men at the White House who refuse to alter the President\&#39;s itinerary no matter how grave the apparent danger is. And, as the election draws closer, Horrigan\&#39;s chances of averting a second tragedy seem progressively less likely.\nJohn Malkovich may be one of the big screen\&#39;s most overlooked actors. Or, at least he was until this performance. It isn\&#39;t that he\&#39;s never done good work before--his version of Lenny in Gary Sinese\&#39;s OF MICE AND MEN was one reason for that film\&#39;s place in my top ten for last year--but most of the time he hasn\&#39;t been recognized for it. However, like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, now that Malkovich has been given a highly visible role in a significant movie, people will hopefully begin to rave about him. The job he does in IN THE LINE OF FIRE is certainly worthy of praise. Hands down, Malkovich\&#39;s assassin is the best thing about this excellent thriller--a villain that rivals Hannibal Lecter for intelligence and cold, calculated viciousness.\nRene Russo gives her strongest performance to date. In truth, she\&#39;s little more than the &#34;window dressing&#34; that Frank Horrigan suggests is the role of female Secret Service agents, but she manages to do a lot with a thankless part. She has quite a bit of screen exposure, but not much meat to sink her teeth into. But, even playing second fiddle to Malkovich and one of Hollywood\&#39;s most popular leading men, she gets noticed.\nEastwood is Eastwood, albeit a more vulnerable version akin to what we saw in UNFORGIVEN. He\&#39;s still tough, and he still isn\&#39;t afraid to use his gun, but Frank Horrigan is a man haunted by his past. He\&#39;s no longer sure whether it was simple indecision or an unwillingness to take a bullet that led to his not being there for Kennedy, and the possibility of the same situation arising a second time troubles him day and night. Horrigan gives us the human side of Eastwood--the side that we never get in a Dirty Harry film, the side that isn\&#39;t afraid to shed a tear.\nDirector Wolfgang Petersen, best known for DAS BOOT, but also at the helm for the taut, twisted SHATTERED, is aware of what\&#39;s necessary to make a good thriller work. He knows the importance of pacing, and plays the tension in IN THE LINE OF FIRE like a virtuoso. Petersen takes what could have been a muddled motion picture and structures it perfectly, creating a superlative piece of entertainment. It helps, of course, that he has a strong cast.\nPlot-wise, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is nothing extraordinary. It\&#39;s basically a formula-type thriller with one or two twists thrown in to keep the view off-balance. However, strength of character, coupled with a consistently high level of excitement, makes this film anything but ordinary. The most intriguing element of IN THE LINE OF FIRE is the cat-and-mouse game between Horrigan and Leary. The relationship of these two characters to each other is fascinating, as it explores psychological layers which many motion pictures find too difficult to convey realistically.\nFor an example of how badly this sort of story (protecting a public figure from a dangerous assassin) can be botched, take a look at last year\&#39;s THE BODYGUARD. While there are similarities in the underlying plot structures of the two movies, development and execution are radically different. IN THE LINE OF FIRE is an intelligent motion picture; THE BODYGUARD represents mindless entertainment.\nIt\&#39;s interesting how some of the most simple special effects can be the most effective. Video manipulation shows a few clips that appear to have Horrigan right in the midst of JFK\&#39;s Dallas entourage. The editing is done exceptionally well; it isn\&#39;t easy to tell that Eastwood wasn\&#39;t behind the President and First Lady. If nothing else, these scenes justify one of the themes of Michael Crichton\&#39;s novel RISING SUN--that video images can no longer be trusted to represent the truth.\nA couple of negatives about IN THE LINE OF FIRE come to mind. First, while the music by Ennio Morricone is effective at times, there is at least one incident--during a rooftop chase--when it sounds like a regurgitation of something from THE UNTOUCHABLES. I know that many composers (including Morricone) have certain &#34;signature&#34; tunes, but this reuse of something he\&#39;s done in the past is a little too blatant for my liking.\nSecondly, Eastwood\&#39;s Horrigan has one-too-many leaps of intuition during the climactic scenes. The overt nature of this plot device is neatly camouflaged by the ever-growing tension of the sequence, but it becomes apparent upon reflection. After all, we\&#39;re dealing with Frank Horrigan, grizzled veteran of the Secret Service, not Sherlock Holmes. There\&#39;s nothing earlier in the film that would lead us to believe that he possesses such powers of deduction.\nOverall, however, this is a fine film, and certainly one of the most intelligent thrillers of the summer. IN THE LINE OF FIRE doesn\&#39;t require the special effects bonanza of JURASSIC PARK to involve the audience, nor does it rely on the mega-budget explosions and mountaintop battles of CLIFFHANGER. Compared to THE FIRM, a movie that some have identified as a picture of similar appeal and temperament, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is far better paced and scripted. So, for a couple of hours of entertainment, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is one of those rare &#34;big&#34; movies that doesn\&#39;t disappoint.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Date Released: 7/23/93 Running Length: 1:48 Rated: PG-13 (Language, mature themes, violence)\nStarring: Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Rosie O&#39;Donnell, Cathy Moriarty, Dennis Farina, Marcia Strassman Director: John Badham Producers: Jim Kouf, Cathleen Summers, Lynn Bigelow Screenplay: Jim Kouf Music: Arthur B. Rubinstein Released by Touchstone Pictures\nThe original STAKEOUT, directed by John Badham, came out in 1987, and was one of my favorite movies of the year. It was a film that skillfully blended its mixture of action and comedy into an entertaining whole. The chemistry between the three leads--Richard Dreyfuss&#39; Chris, Emilio Estevez&#39; Bill, and Madeleine Stowe&#39;s Maria--was as good as it comes in movies. STAKEOUT ended up being more than just another cop/buddy film.\nNow, six years later, John Badham is back along with Dreyfuss and Estevez (and the entire production team, including the writer, Jim Kouf, and the score composer, Arthur B. Rubinstein). The relationship between Chris and Bill hasn&#39;t changed much over six years, and neither has the mingling of action and humor. This time, Chris and Bill, along with Rosie O&#39;Donnell&#39;s assistant DA, are looking for a witness on the run who&#39;s going to testify against the mob. Posing as a family, they move into a house next to the couple with whom contact may or may not be initiated. Another stakeout is under way.\nWhen I first received the credit list for this movie, I skimmed through it to see who from the original would be returning. Much to my chagrin, Madeleine Stowe&#39;s name did not appear. This, in my opinion, was a huge mistake. While Estevez and Dreyfuss worked well together, it was the inclusion of Maria&#39;s character that lent an extra spark to the movie. It was hard to imagine how a STAKEOUT movie could function well without her.\nFortunately, however, Stowe&#39;s Maria is present in ANOTHER STAKEOUT, albeit in an uncredited performance. It&#39;s more than a cameo, however. She&#39;s in four scenes and has more screen time than at least two of the actors whose names appear in the opening credits (Dan Lauria and Sharon Maughan). And yes, her scenes with Dreyfuss are still as well-played as ever. She may not have a major role in this installment, but her inclusion is an especially nice tip of the cap to continuity and what made the original movie effective. Now, on to what makes this film work.\nIf done together well, comedy and action can make an excellent pairing. This has been proven many times, most notably in LETHAL WEAPON and the original STAKEOUT. It is evident here. If anything, this movie leans more towards outright humor than the first, and the action is consequently toned down. More importantly, ANOTHER STAKEOUT doesn&#39;t try to copy the first. The scenario is entirely different, as are the gags and the tempo.\nThe inclusion of Rosie O&#39;Donnell, comedienne-turned-actress, is a brilliant move. Without her presence, this movie wouldn&#39;t have worked nearly as well. She forms a quick rapport with Bill and Chris (of the love/hate variety), and the movie is off and running. O&#39;Donnell is rapidly making an name for herself, and with good reason. Unlike Rita Rudner, another veteran of the stand-up routine who is venturing into movies, O&#39;Donnell can act.\nDreyfuss is as solid as ever, and seems to genuinely enjoy playing Chris. He steals a fair number of scenes, but that&#39;s true of almost any movie that he has a part in. Emilio Estevez, never one of my favorite actors, does a decent job. He&#39;s much better in the scenes he shares with Dreyfuss than those he has to carry on his own. Of course, that&#39;s not a big surprise.\nMiguel Ferrer is not as charismatic or successful a villain as Aidan Quinn (whose performance as Maria&#39;s escaped convict ex-boyfriend galvanized STAKEOUT), but he&#39;s good enough for the purposes of this movie. Dan Lauria is on hand again, reprising his role, although in the interim spanning the two films, his character has gotten promoted to chief, and he&#39;s just itching to find some way to stick it to his two least-favorite detectives.\nANOTHER STAKEOUT is tremendous fun. There&#39;s a lot of highly amusing (bordering on hilarious) humor, and the action scenes are handled with an eye for pacing and tension. If people find this gem in the midst of so many bigger name motion pictures, this is likely to be a huge crowd- pleaser. Because of the uncertainty of whether it will be noticed, I question the wisdom of releasing ANOTHER STAKEOUT at this time. Perhaps, like FOR LOVE OR MONEY, it should have been put off to the autumn.\nIn general, I don&#39;t think the second STAKEOUT is as good as the first, but it is a worthy successor. Since virtually everyone involved in the 1987 picture is back for this one, the sense of continuity is seamless, both in big and little things. More importantly, because it actually has an entertaining story to tell, this is not one of the ever-growing number of sequels that should never have been made. Fans of the original movie will almost certainly be happy with ANOTHER STAKEOUT, and those that didn&#39;t see it won&#39;t be lost. This movie is well worth a look. It&#39;s one of the summer&#39;s best at providing unfettered enjoyment.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Starring: Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy, Omri Katz, Thora Birch, Vinessa Shaw Director: Kenny Ortega Producers: David Kirschner and Steven Haft Screenplay: Mick Garris and Neil Cuthbert Music: John Debney Released by Walt Disney Pictures\nIt\&#39;s 1693 and a trio of witches (Winifred, played by Bette Midler; Sarah, played by Sarah Jessica Parker; and Mary, played by Kathy Najimy) are preparing a spell that will ensure them immortality and eternal youth. However, before the magic is complete, the people of Salem capture and execute the three for consorting with the devil. Before their deaths, the witches vow to return on some future All Hallow\&#39;s Eve. Three hundred years later, a skeptic by the name of Max (Omri Katz) ventures into the ruins of the witches\&#39; house, daring the supernatural to manifest itself. Heedless of warnings of his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and schoolmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max lights the dreaded Candle of Black Flame. Suddenly, the three Sanderson sisters have a second lease on life, and this time they don\&#39;t intend to waste it. Now it\&#39;s up to Max, with the help of Dani, Allison, and a talking black cat, to correct his error and stop them before it\&#39;s too late.\nLike so many films that mix genres, in trying to do too much, HOCUS POCUS succeeds in very little. The comedy is sporadic and not often tremendously funny, the horror won\&#39;t frighten anyone over 8, and the adventure is dull and routine. As a family film, HOCUS POCUS is passable--you can take the kids to it and they\&#39;ll probably have a good time--but there doesn\&#39;t seem to be any great advantage in venturing into a theater to see this movie. It\&#39;s unremarkable enough that it won\&#39;t lose much on video.\nIt seems that the root of HOCUS POCUS\&#39; weaknesses lies in its inability to develop believable characters. In the absence of nonstop, uproarious comedy or pulse-pounding action, strong characters are needed. What we get, however, are a number of poorly-written creations that are taken from the writers\&#39; stock of readily-available personalities. For the most part, the scenes that are intended to set up relationships are laughably absurd and difficult to accept.\nPoor acting comes into play. Omri Katz is a bad choice for the hero of this piece. Actually, &#34;hero&#34; might not be the right word for his role--Max is so stupid and annoying at times that we wish the witches would stick him in their kettle and boil him alive. He treats his little sister like a burden (which is not entirely unrealistic for someone his age) and does some of the most amazingly stupid things. Everything that happens in HOCUS POCUS is essentially his fault.\nThe normally-steady Bette Midler has some fun chewing on the scenery in a part that is played as intended: over-the-top. Clearly in Ms. Midler\&#39;s shadow, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy give such muted performances as to be virtually invisible. They do a lot of Three Stooges\&#39; physical gags, but without having mastered timing.\nGenerally, HOCUS POCUS lacks energy. The direction by Kenny Ortega (who began his career as a choreographer) is flat, and the camerawork workmanlike (this is surprising considering that the cinematographer is Hiro Narita). The audience\&#39;s basic disconnection with the characters is part of the problem, but that\&#39;s not all of it. HOCUS POCUS is not a lot of fun. The film basically amounts to a great deal of pointless running around. The inventiveness that we keep expecting never materializes and by the end we\&#39;re still wondering if and when something\&#39;s going to happen to either galvanize us or cause us to double over with laughter.\nThe previews for this film give a good indication of the movie\&#39;s overall quality--it\&#39;s like a live-action &#34;Broom Hilda.&#34; The best part of the movie--a couple of cameos by brother and sister Gary and Penny Marshall--are also highlighted by HOCUS POCUS\&#39; theatrical trailers, so they aren\&#39;t much of a surprise when they happen.\nThere are a few special effects in HOCUS POCUS, but nothing new or ground-breaking. The walking corpse isn\&#39;t a masterpiece of design, but it\&#39;s done well--neither too real to be genuinely frightening nor too fake to be laughable. The parts of the film with the zombie try too hard to be campy, the results of which are less-than-successful. For fun at the expense of the dead, see Sam Raimi\&#39;s latest directorial venture, ARMY OF DARKNESS.\nAt any rate, HOCUS POCUS is an occasionally dull, mostly pedantic motion picture with little to recommend it. It belongs on the long list of summer movies that will quickly be buried and forgotten until it surfaces on video in another six months. Frankly, that\&#39;s the fate it deserves. It isn\&#39;t putrid but, for my money, there are quite a few other films I\&#39;d see before this one. HOCUS POCUS never lives up to what little potential the premise has.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Jason James Richter, Lori Petty, Michael Madsen, Jayne Atkinson, Michael Ironside Director: Simon Wincer Producers: Jennie Lew Tugend and Lauren Shuler-Donner Screenplay: Keith A. Walker and Corey Blechman Music: Basil Poledouris Released by Warner Brothers\nTraditionally, Man\&#39;s (or Woman\&#39;s) best friend is considered to be his (or her) dog. Sometimes, even a cat. But rarely is the love and affection of a boy won over by a killer whale. Such is the case in FREE WILLY, however, where young Jesse\&#39;s unusual relationship with an orca leads to his own redemption.\nAbandoned by his mother when he was little, Jesse (Jason James Richter) has lived most of his life on the streets or in what is euphemistically called a &#34;childrens\&#39; home.&#34; After Jesse is caught spraypainting graffiti all over the observation windows to Willy the whale\&#39;s holding tank, his probation is to return to the scene of the crime by day and clean up the mess he made. Along the way, Jesse strikes up an unusual friendship with Willy and manages to get closer to the whale than Rae Lindley (Lori Petty), the trainer. Meanwhile, Jesse has been &#34;rescued&#34; from the home by Annie and Glen Greenwood (Michael Madsen), a couple looking for a young boy to share their home. Even though Annie and Glen seem like nice people, Jesse isn\&#39;t sure it\&#39;s a good situation for him, especially since he regards the rules of the house as little more than a thinly-veiled attempt to curtail his freedom.\nBack in the late seventies, Dino DeLaurentis, the master of overbudgeted, poorly-written films, came out with a movie called ORCA: THE KILLER WHALE. Starring Richard Harris and Charlotte Rampling, and clearly designed as a rip-off of JAWS, this movie presented whales in the most negative light possible. They were beasts who lived to hunt, and man made a suitable prey. Now, approximately fifteen years later, we have been given this movie, one that presents the orca in a more reasonable--and believable--light.\nFREE WILLY is not a great film--it relies on entirely too many cliches and formulas for that to be true. In fact, there won\&#39;t be many people going into the theater not knowing exactly how the movie is going to end (take a look at a TV commercial, theatrical trailer, or even the newspaper print ad). Despite that, FREE WILLY is a solid source of family entertainment, and a good reason to take the kids to the movies. This is one of those too-rare films that is capable of enthralling those under and over the age of twelve. There\&#39;s a little bit in FREE WILLY for people of all age groups.\nFormula motion pictures, if done well, can be entertaining. Sure, you know what\&#39;s going to happen, but with good acting, direction, and photography, not to mention a few believable characters and some intelligent dialogue, it can still be fun travelling that oft-trodden road to the expected resolution.\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR and HOCUS POCUS are examples of this summer\&#39;s family fare that fall on their faces. FREE WILLY avoids the traps that ensnare these movies, keeping clear of the mind-numbing idiocy of ROOKIE and the boredom of HOCUS POCUS. Instead, this film weaves a simple-yet-effective tale about a boy and his whale. It\&#39;s almost like Lassie or Old Yeller in water.\nThis is the second venture into family movies for executive producer Richard Donner (of SUPERMAN and LETHAL WEAPON fame). His previous effort, which he directed, was a little-known and muddled fantasy about abused children. Called RADIO FLYER, it was a failure with the critics and at the box office. This time around, Donner has involved himself in a family movie with more appeal and fewer problems.\nIt should be mentioned that FREE WILLY isn\&#39;t an error-free film. There are numerous scenes, especially those involving Jesse in his petulant moods, that don\&#39;t work. While the ending wraps up the major element of the plot, there\&#39;s still a lot left unresolved, including what the one-dimensional villain Dial (played rather flatly by Michael Ironside) is going to do to those who stole his property. There are also various occasions throughout the running time when logic and reality are conveniently ignored or abandoned altogether. FREE WILLY isn\&#39;t a movie that stands up well to careful inspection. Most of the flaws aren\&#39;t major, however, and are easy to overlook.\nThe movie\&#39;s biggest asset is its actors. Twelve-year old Jason James Richter does a credible job as Jesse. This may be his first film, but you can\&#39;t tell it from the polished performance he gives. Lori Petty proves that there are still a few worthwhile roles for women in American films. In her hands, Rae is every bit as strong and capable as any of the men in this picture.\nStill vivid in my mind is the image of Michael Madsen dancing to the tune of &#34;Stuck in the Middle with You&#34; as, with knife in hand, he approaches a tied-up cop. However, while Madsen doesn\&#39;t bury RESERVOIR DOGS\&#39; Mr. Blonde, at least he temporarily removes the picture of the psychotic killer from the minds of those in the audience who have seen Quentin Tarnatino\&#39;s bloody thriller. Madsen\&#39;s Glen is a somewhat-gruff man who wants a child, but doesn\&#39;t exactly know how to handle the one that he gets. On paper, this character may have been a cliche, but as portrayed by a veteran character actor, he comes across as a real person.\nPerhaps the best reason to see FREE WILLY on the big screen is the photography. Both underwater and above-the-surface scenes are filmed with style, and much of the impact will be lost in a television picture. The special effects are good--it\&#39;s almost impossible to tell where the real whales end and the mechanical ones begin.\nDon\&#39;t be put off by the stupid title. FREE WILLY is actually an above-average movie that most people will find something to like about. It only gets preachy once or twice about the &#34;save the whales&#34; issue, and is never more obvious than a film like STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME. FREE WILLY has a good message, is enjoyably constructed, and includes several small moments of majesty.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Donald Sutherland, Amy Irving, Rider Strong, Graham Greene, Christopher McDonald Director: Jonathan Heap Producers: Michael Spielberg and Brad M. Gilbert Screenplay: Jeffrey Polman and Christopher Keyser from a story by Michael Lieber Music: Gary Denton Released by Miramax Films\nThe memories are no longer clear, but Karen Braswell (Amy Irving) knows that it was her testimony twenty-two years ago that sent her father Frank (Donald Sutherland) to jail. Essentially, it was her word against his, and the jury believed her. For over two decades, she has never once doubted that Frank killed her mother but, after he visits her following his release from prison, she has cause to wonder. She then confronts the District Attorney who put her on the witness stand. From him Karen learns that her testimony had been coached, and that the man she has hated since the age of twelve might be innocent of the crime she caused him to be convicted of.\nSounds like a pretty good basis for a psychological thriller/drama, right? The premise is good and, given a well-written script, the execution could have produced a memorable film. However, somewhere before the midpoint of this movie, things go so badly wrong that BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT collapses, changing from an intriguing motion picture into a formula-riddled, ghoulish disaster.\nUsually, it\&#39;s up to independent movie distributors like Miramax to give us unique thrillers (such as THE CRYING GAME). However, in this case, Miramax has reached into its grab-bag and drawn out something that couldn\&#39;t possibly be any more Hollywood-like. With little to claim in the way of originality (except perhaps the setup), BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT is a cross of a number of recent thrillers. The most obvious source material comes from THE STEPFATHER, which is ripped off shamelessly and ineffectively.\nExactly who is the intended audience for this movie? Simply put, the picture involves a lot of the murder and exploitation that appeals to mass audiences, but there are too many slow-moving sequences to effectively draw from that portion of the film-going population. Also, BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT is opening in a small number of &#34;select&#34; theaters including, of all places, several &#34;art houses&#34;. This is definitely not a picture for the viewers who frequent those venues. It appears that Miramax, normally known as a genius of marketing, has made a major blunder here--not only in distribution, but in backing the production in the first place.\nFrom a certain point, BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT gets continuously worse. Once it starts down the slippery track of cinematic ugliness, it seems to embrace the descent. Plot twists cease to make sense, characters lose the tentative three-dimensionality they had been striving for, and the audience stops caring about what\&#39;s going on. And, of course, the body count mounts. We\&#39;re treated to several rather bloody and brutal murders.\nAmy Irving, hardly looking like herself with straight blonde hair, gives a reasonably effective performance, but eventually the script and dialogue get the better of her. Similarly, Donald Sutherland starts out strong, but as the plot grows progressively more ridiculous, his part becomes flat. Graham Greene is uniformly unimpressive in a role that is completely superfluous.\nThe only thing that BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT is adept at is showing off the Arizona countryside. So much running back and forth goes on that it\&#39;s impossible not to get an eyefull of the sand, buttes, and canyons. Unfortunately, as the movie progresses, the scenery becomes far more interesting than a story that becomes as ridiculous as it is predictable.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Date Released: varies Running Length: 1:33 Rated: NC-17 (Graphic violence, language, nudity, rape)\nStarring: Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde, Andre Bonzei Director: Remy Belvaux Producers: Belvaux, Poelvoorde, and Bonzei Screenplay: Belvaux, Poelvoorde, Bonzei, and Vincent Tavier Released by Roxie Releasing French with English subtitles\nMAN BITES DOG is a pseudo-documentary that follows the killing sprees of the murderous Benoit (Benoit Poelvoorde). With cameras rolling, he calmly explains his theories about killing people and weighing down the bodies so they won&#39;t float to the surface of whatever river or lake he dumps them in. He then proceeds to slaughter person after person, respecting neither age nor sex nor race, and murdering in a wide variety of ways from strangulation to a bullet to the head. All the while, the film crew trails him, heedless of the danger they put themselves in, and uncaring as they are drawn deeper and deeper into the psychotic, criminal world of their subject.\nAs a short, this could have been a brilliant, blistering satire on society&#39;s views of violence and how it relates to movies. However, MAN BITES DOG is a full-length feature and, as such, spends a little too much time with its subject. Thirty minutes, or even forty-five, would have been a perfect length, but by the end of the third half-hour, certain elements of this movie (namely Ben&#39;s endless philosophizing) have grown tired. The violence has lost its edge and the movie has begun to meander.\nNevertheless, despite the possibly-excessive length, there is still a lot to praise in this obscure effort by a trio of previously-unknown Belgian film makers. They have taken violence in the cinema to its ultimate limit and created an always-irreverent, often darkly funny look at killers and victims.\nEvery moment of this film is shot documentary-style in grainy black-and-white. This pseudo-realism, complete with choppy editing and unsteady, hand-held camera shots, gives an eerie air of legitimacy to MAN BITES DOG. Added to that, the three main characters in the film all use their real names. The film makers are Remy and Andre, and the killer is Benoit.\nBenoit possesses an especially interesting personae. Heartless as a killer, he&#39;s actually a fun guy to be around most of the time. He loves his girlfriend and adores his family. He&#39;s smart and thoughtful, often giving lengthy discourses on various aspects of life and death. Then, the next thing you know, he&#39;s blowing someone&#39;s brains out or raping a woman while her naked husband looks on in horror.\nAn issue addressed by MAN BITES DOG is how intimately the media becomes involved in the stories they cover. Are they simply reporting the facts or, by their mere presence, are they participating in them? The answer given by this film isn&#39;t obscure as the movie makers slowly come to assist Ben in his various crimes. At first, it&#39;s just little things like shining a light in a certain spot, but it doesn&#39;t take long before they&#39;re actually joining in.\nAt one time or another, comparisons have been made between this film and a couple of other recent, gut-wrenching productions--HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER and RESERVOIR DOGS. From my point-of-view, while there are superficial similarities between these pictures and MAN BITES DOG, the basic thrust is radically different. RESERVOIR DOGS and HENRY are both serious movies. MAN BITES DOG approaches itself and its subject with tongue planted firmly in cheek.\nOne of the most hilarious moments in the film comes when Ben has a shoot-out with another killer. After Ben kills his rival, the film crew catches up with him standing over the body. At that moment, another group of men with cameras show up--they had been doing a documentary about the exploits of the now-dead man. Dark, twisted humor like this characterizes MAN BITES DOG.\nThe limited budget of the film shows, but in a way that adds to the genuine feel of what we&#39;re seeing. The plot has a couple of twists that allow us to see various emotions from all of the principals of MAN BITES DOG. Nevertheless, through the entire movie, the only character to be effectively developed is that of the killer, Ben.\nObviously not a movie for everyone, MAN BITES DOG boasts graphic displays of murder and rape. There&#39;s very little of the human body--inside or out--that isn&#39;t shown at one time or another during the course of this movie. Nevertheless, if you do venture to see MAN BITES DOG, you would have to be made out of stone to miss the visceral, sardonic impact of a highly-unusual film.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Date Released: 7/30/93 Running Length: 1:33 Rated: PG-13 (Language, dead animal carcasses, brief nudity)\nStarring: Mike Myers, Nancy Travis, Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer, Brenda Fricker Director: Thomas Schlamme Producers: Robert N. Fried and Cary Woods Screenplay: Robbie Fox Music: Bruce Broughton Released by TriStar Pictures\nCharlie MacKenzie (Mike Myers) hasn\&#39;t had the best luck with women, although the problem is more with him than his dates. He can\&#39;t commit (the notion of marriage frightens him to death), so whenever a relationship starts to get serious, Charlie finds an excuse to dump her. Hey, if she smells like beef vegetable soup, that\&#39;s a good enough reason. This time, however, Charlie is really smitten. There\&#39;s only one problem--an increasing amount of evidence seems to point to Harriet (Nancy Travis) as being the mysterious Mrs. X, a woman who is suspected of having married, then killed, three men.\nA good indication that this movie didn\&#39;t work for me is that I never cared whether or not Nancy Travis\&#39; Harriet was an axe murderer. The characters--and it\&#39;s not just her\&#39;s--are so paper-thin that it doesn\&#39;t make a difference who lives or dies, and who does the killing. There isn\&#39;t enough life in these people even to consider them caricatures.\nP. D. James need not worry. The creative team behind this film is not poised to steal away her title of the &#34;Queen of Crime.&#34; Mysteries are supposed to be complex, intriguing, and beguiling, with the audience unsure of the truth until the very end. None of these things is true of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER. In fact, the solution is so obviously telegraphed that it\&#39;s possible to have the answer fifteen minutes into the movie. Of course, given the number of logical flaws in the resolution, it\&#39;s a safe bet that you won\&#39;t have gotten everything right. It\&#39;s impossible to predict things that don\&#39;t make sense.\nSo, having established that there\&#39;s no reason to care for the characters and that the murder mystery plot is as feeble as they come, that leaves only the comedy to comment on. As I\&#39;ve said before, any movie can overcome flaws if it\&#39;s funny enough. Laughter is the best paint to hide the cracks in the story. John Cleese\&#39;s A FISH CALLED WANDA is an excellent example of this. Unfortunately, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is not.\nNot only is the humor banal, it\&#39;s only fitfully amusing. For every joke that works, there are half a dozen that fall flat. Apparently Mike Myers thinks he\&#39;s a lot funnier than he actually is. The whole Scottish shtick with Charlie\&#39;s father (also played by Myers) wears thin quickly, but Myers keeps pushing it long after it\&#39;s ceased to elicit more than forced chuckles.\nThere are three nice cameos in the film. The best of these belongs to Alan Arkin, who plays a nice police chief trying to act tough to please one of his detectives. Arkin is only in a few scenes, so there\&#39;s not enough time for the gag to get overused. Also good is Charles Grodin as a car driver who refuses to let his vehicle be commandeered. Finally, although not quite as good as the other two, but still worth a mention, is Phil Hartman\&#39;s Alcatraz security guard. Excepting perhaps Leslie Nielsen, few actors do deadpan better than Hartman.\nThere\&#39;s nothing in SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER to make this film worthwhile entertainment. It\&#39;s about as unspectacular a production as there is, with the typical level of juvenile comedy that the writer, director, and actors think is funnier than those stuck in a theater watching the picture.\nSneak previews of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER paired this movie with WEEKEND AT BERNIE\&#39;S 2. The thought of sitting through these films back-to-back makes me shudder. One at a time is bad enough, but both in four hours? Of the two, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is the better production. Not much better, but an improvement nonetheless. Faint praise indeed, considering the competition.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Michelle Burke, Chris Farley, Michael McKean Director: Steve Barron Producer: Lorne Michaels Screenplay: Tom Davis, Dan Aykroyd, Bonnie Turner, and Terry Turner Music: David Newman Released by Paramount Pictures\nOne night in the late 1970s (as near as I can figure--time scales in this film are difficult to follow), a spaceship on the way from Remulak to Earth crashes in New York\&#39;s East River. On board are Beldar (Dan Aykroyd) and Prymaat (Jane Curtin). Because of the state of their ship, they are forced to seek refuge on this planet rather than conquer it. Unfortunately, Beldar lacks a green card, so it doesn\&#39;t take long before the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) finds out about him. With a baby on the way, Beldar gets a job first as an appliance repair person, then as a cab driver, to make enough money to buy a house in New Jersey. However, even as the Conehead family goes in search of the American Dream, Gorman Seedling (Michael McKean) of the INS goes in search of them.\nIt\&#39;s amazing that there\&#39;s such a merchandising push surrounding this film. Not only are there Conehead dolls, figurines, and other assorted paraphernalia, but Subway restaurants have a deal with Paramount to market a &#34;Mass Quantities&#34; meal (Subway also has a prominent product placement in the film). All of this may turn out to be a huge miscalculation on someone\&#39;s part. Based on the audience I saw this picture with, CONEHEADS may be headed down the same road as LAST ACTION HERO (which was a much better film).\nOccasionally, the ten-minute sketch on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE was good for a chuckle or two, but given an extra eighty-minutes, CONEHEADS turns into a tedious bore. It\&#39;s hard to believe how anything utilizing the services of the normally-engaging Dan Aykroyd could be so completely unfunny (then again, he was in DOCTOR DETROIT, but even that had a couple of amusing moments). I didn\&#39;t laugh out loud once during this entire motion picture, which is a bad sign.\nI expected stupid humor, silly humor, or bizarre humor, but not no humor. The scenes in the previews are unfortunately representative of the entire movie, with the quirky speech patterns of Beldar and Prymaat being the big selling point. Oddly enough, one of the snippets I saw the most frequently--that of Aykroyd opening a six-pack and guzzling down the beer--is playing somewhere on the cutting room floor. It didn\&#39;t make the final print.\nCONEHEADS boasts some nice special effects when the setting shifts from Earth to Remulak. While there\&#39;s nothing groundbreaking here, there\&#39;s a nasty monster (which looks like something out of RETURN OF THE JEDI) that\&#39;s done well enough to be believable, and the Remulakian space fleet looks imposing.\nThe movie starts out okay, but it\&#39;s hard to keep a story this thin going for long, and by the half-hour point (around the time that Connie Conehead is born), it becomes painfully obvious that the decision to create a full-length feature out of this subject material was a colossal mistake. Even the presence of numerous past and present SNL cast members (including Chris Farley, Jon Lovitz, Jan Hooks, and Phil Hartman) can\&#39;t save this overbloated, poorly-conceived tripe.\nLovers of the Coneheads sketches will probably find this film entertaining--and perhaps even enjoyable. They\&#39;re about the only ones that will be true of, though. For everyone else, CONEHEADS will be much like an endurance contest--and the one who sticks it out to the end may not be the winner.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Jeff Bridges, Edward Furlong, Lucinda Jenny, Tracey Kapisky, Don Harvey, Melvyn Hayward Director: Martin Bell Producers: Rosilyn Heller and Jeff Bridges Screenplay: Peter Silverman Music: James Newton-Howard; songs by Tom Waits Released by Triton Pictures\nJack Kelson (Jeff Bridges) is an ex-con just out of jail, trying to get his new chance at life off to a good start. Unfortunately, circumstances conspiring against him. His fourteen year old son Nick (Edward Furlong) has run away from Jack\&#39;s sister\&#39;s farm, where he was staying, and has sought out his father. At first, Jack seeks to send the boy back, but when Nick won\&#39;t budge, he has no choice but to let him stay. Their relationship is strained, however, and Jack isn\&#39;t a very good role model. With each passing day, problems mount, and the easy money offered by Jack\&#39;s old way of life becomes a temptation increasingly more difficult to resist.\nIt\&#39;s a gross disservice to AMERICAN HEART to describe it thematically as a &#34;white BOYZ \&#39;N THE HOOD&#34;, but that phrase gets across the kind of story that director Martin Bell and screenwriter Peter Silverman are trying to tell. This movie is about the life of poor whites struggling to make it in the inner city. The setting is Seattle, but it could just as easily be any other city in the United States. As was true with BOYZ, the problems--and their lack of solutions--are universal.\nSet against the backdrop of poverty and violence is the father-and-son relationship which forms the core of the movie. Jack and Nick don\&#39;t have a great rapport, but as the movie progresses, they struggle to find some sort of connection. Jack doesn\&#39;t know how to be a good parent, and really doesn\&#39;t want to start trying, but it\&#39;s obvious that he loves his kid and wants Nick to have better opportunities than he had.\nAll three subplots are as engaging as the main story. One, which follows the development of Jack\&#39;s affair with Charlotte, a female pen-pal (Lucinda Jenny) he started corresponding with while in prison, is exceptionally well-written, especially considering the dynamics that her presence adds to the already-uncertain father/son relationship. Nick resents Charlotte\&#39;s presence, feeling that she is taking away time that Jack should be spending with him.\nAs the film progresses, Nick gets a girlfriend of his own--Molly (Tracey Kapisky), a fifteen year old streetwalker whose mother is a topless dancer. Molly introduces Nick to, among other things, drugs and crime. Despite Jack\&#39;s warnings that she\&#39;ll break his heart, Nick can\&#39;t stay away from her. She\&#39;s as addictive as the Marijuana that he smokes with her.\nThen there\&#39;s the constant re-appearance of Jack\&#39;s old partner, Rainey (Don Harvey), who wants either Jack or Nick to accompany him on his next job--the robbery of a jewelry store. Considering the poor state of Jack\&#39;s finances, it\&#39;s a tempting offer, but he realizes that to attain his modest dream of traveling north to set up a life in Alaska, he has to keep his hands clean. Whether Nick can resist the lure of &#34;easy money&#34; is another matter altogether.\nAMERICAN HEART throws formulas out the window. When you expect something to happen, don\&#39;t be sure that it will. There\&#39;s certainly no adherence to a Hollywood-type resolution. The atmosphere throughout this film is stark, but the tone is not so relentlessly bleak that it disallows a little humor. Given the dark nature of the movie, each of the few lighthearted moments is needed.\nJeff Bridges, who has shown a capacity for playing grungy, downtrodden men throughout his career, gives an excellent performance here. Jack is the kind of man you can sympathize with--a villain trying to go straight, and you can see and feel him through the image that Bridges presents. While this probably isn\&#39;t the actor\&#39;s career role, he brings his character to life, infusing him with believability and energy.\nWould that Edward Furlong does as well with Nick. Furlong, whose top roles to date have come in a couple films demanding little in the acting department (TERMINATOR 2 and PET SEMETARY 2), displays his lack of ability in AMERICAN HEART. For the most part, he has two modes: a blank face and a peeved expression. Anything else is a bonus. Perhaps it\&#39;s just a case of underplaying every scene. Fortunately, few scenes demand that Furlong carry them, and he has a fine supporting cast to keep audience recognition of his faults to a minimum.\nAMERICAN HEART is the kind of hard-hitting, issue-confronting drama that are few and far between these days. The film is in limited distribution, so it may be difficult to find but, given the opportunity, it\&#39;s definitely worth a look.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Sean Connery, Wesley Snipes, Harvey Keitel, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Kevin Anderson Director: Philip Kaufman Producer: Peter Kaufman Screenplay: Philip Kaufman, Michael Crichton, and Michael Backes based on the novel by Michael Crichton Music: Toru Takemitsu Released by Twentieth Century Fox\nIn an empty conference room on the forty-sixth floor of Los Angeles\&#39; Nakatomo Tower, the dead body of a beautiful young call girl has been found sprawled out on a table. When Lieutenant Tom Graham (Harvey Keitel), the racist cop in charge, has trouble obtaining the full cooperation of the Nakatomo execs, Special Services liaison Lieutenant Web Smith (Wesley Snipes) is summoned for help. Along the way, Smith receives a call on the car phone telling him to pick up Captain John Connor (Sean Connery), a man known to be well-versed in Japanese traditions and, in the opinion of some, a Japanese sympathizer. Nothing about this investigation is straightforward, but as more is revealed about the details of the case, Connor and Smith find themselves &#34;in the warzone&#34; of a business battle in which life is a commodity easily lost.\nMichael Crichton\&#39;s RISING SUN, in addition to being a gripping mystery/thriller, functioned as a scathing attack on American apathy to Japanese economic aggression. In fact, in his afterword to the novel, Crichton says, &#34;The Japanese are not our saviors. They are our competitors. We should not forget it.&#34; Statements like these earned RISING SUN the dubious distinction of being a Japan-bashing novel. Now, with the arrival of Philip Kaufman\&#39;s film, the protests which greeted the book\&#39;s publication have started anew.\nAlthough the movie RISING SUN is mostly faithful to the written work which inspired it (Michael Crichton gets his second co-screenwriting credit of the summer, although he dropped out of this project early on), much of the anti-Japanese sentiment has been toned down. There is little that someone watching the film with an unbiased eye will notice. Great pains are gone to the present as many positives as negatives in the Japanese way of life, and there are as many sleazy Americans as there are Japanese in the movie. Crude Asian stereotypes and caricatures are avoided, and care is taken to give the good guys a few vices and the bad guys a few virtues.\nWith the exception of an ill-timed and confusing ending, the movie follows the general plotline of the book surprisingly well. There are changes of course, but nothing as wholesale or drastic as what destroyed the screen version of THE FIRM. Despite altering the specifics of the killer\&#39;s identity, the main culprits remain the same. A few additional action scenes have been added (Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes enter into a hand-to-hand struggle with a bunch of Japanese thugs) to keep the audience\&#39;s attention, and a great deal of Crichton\&#39;s detail on Japanese culture has been dropped. It fits nicely into the printed version, but would have made the film talky and overly long.\nThe most obvious book-to-movie change is the casting of black actor Wesley Snipes as a character that is white in the book. Actually, as things turn out, the race of Lieutenant Smith becomes almost irrelevant, except in one scene new to the movie where Smith uses a bunch of his ghetto buddies to help him out of a scrape. With much of the intended comedy failing in this instance, this was not one of the better alterations. It\&#39;s far too silly.\nOne of the problems with getting a rising star of Wesley Snipes\&#39; stature to play opposite Sean Connery is that Lieutenant Smith can\&#39;t simply be the Watson to Connor\&#39;s Holmes. Admittedly, there was some friction between the two in the book, but it\&#39;s nothing like what\&#39;s present in the movie, where the two almost come to blows (actually, Smith wants to fight while Connor looks at him like an amused parent with a misbehaving child).\nThe mystery itself is well-presented, with the usual twists, turns, and red herrings. The scenes with Tia Carrere\&#39;s video guru, as she attempts to uncover the doctoring that has been done to a laser disk containing a video copy of a surveillance camera\&#39;s recording of the murder, are among the most fascinating moments of the film. What\&#39;s done to the disks certainly makes you realize that pictures--whether moving or not--can no longer be trusted.\nThe ending is a little sloppy, with a bit too much &#34;Hollywood&#34; added, and a long, drawn-out scene with Snipes and Carrere that\&#39;s pointless. I would have left RISING SUN with a slightly-better taste in my mouth had the final moments been pruned out. Apparently the writers wanted the solve the one outstanding mystery of the film in the most idiotic way possible.\nConnery, who reportedly was Crichton\&#39;s &#34;model&#34; for John Connor during the original writing, seems born to play the role. He slips into it with ease and, as always, is a joy to watch. Wesley Snipes is a little erratic , unexpectedly having a few instances where his performance doesn\&#39;t ring true. Harvey Keitel, underused as the bigoted cop who opens the investigation, seethes with spoken--and unspoken--hatred for everything Japanese.\nDirector Philip Kaufman, who has previously tackled the book-to-screen adaptations of THE RIGHT STUFF and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, knows how to create a taut, tightly-paced film. There aren\&#39;t many letdowns in RISING SUN; the film moves implacably on, gathering steam as it goes. The authentic-sounding Japanese music of composer Toru Takemitsu helps the movie\&#39;s tone immeasurably.\nRISING SUN is a mixed bag that contains more positives than negatives. Those who have not read the book will probably have a better impression than those who have (although they will wonder about the inclusion of certain seemingly-irrelevant characters--such as Smith\&#39;s wife--whose roles in the film have been chopped down to virtually nothing). Then again, that\&#39;s almost always the case with film adaptations. At least in this case, lovers of the book won\&#39;t be shaking their heads in horror as they did with THE FIRM and SLIVER. RISING SUN is a pretty good movie, but it\&#39;s still a better novel.\n&#39;,
 &#34;THE LONG DAY CLOSES is a film that takes several months in the life of Bud (Leigh McCormack), a twelve year old boy growing up in 1956 Liverpool, and gives us a series of glimpses into some of the most ordinary, everyday moments that occur. This is a movie without plot and with precious little characterization. It moves along at a snail&#39;s pace, progressively losing more and more of the audience as it becomes apparent that absolutely nothing is going to happen.\nTHE LONG DAY CLOSES is very much the visual equivalent of a verse or a poem: beautiful images, but no narrative (that&#39;s not to imply that poems often don&#39;t have deeper meanings). This movie is a visual feast and a cinematographer&#39;s dream, but for the average movie-goer, eighty-three minutes of odd camera-angles and interesting shots is too much.\nThe audience at the showing I attended numbered about twenty at the start of the film. By the end, it was down to about fifteen. Personally, I don&#39;t think the movie was bad enough to walk out on, but I can understand why those who left did so. Movies can survive without coherent stories if they have solid, three-dimensional characters. THE LONG DAY CLOSES has neither and, as a result, ends up being an overly-long bore. Numerous opportunities for character development are left dangling, and we&#39;re forced to watch a bunch of people we never get to feel for. Even Bud, who&#39;s in nearly every scene, is flat and uninteresting.\nSupposedly, Terence Davies has filmed his childhood memories. That&#39;s an interesting notion, and in the context of the movie, it&#39;s easy to see how this could be the case- a great deal of attention is paid to the smallest details. Unfortunately, except in unusual circumstances, the mundane recollections of a person aren&#39;t the kinds of cinematic gems designed to captivate an audience. There are a few incidents in THE LONG DAY CLOSES that briefly caught my attention, but they couldn&#39;t hold it. On those rare occasions when the film managed to strike a responsive chord within me, it let the opportunity slip away. Then it was back to staring at meaningless images on the screen again.\nI can&#39;t recommend THE LONG DAY CLOSES to any but the most devout art film students and die-hard lovers of unusual cinematography. For anyone else that happens to see this movie, they will likely find the title a fitting one. After getting out of the theater, it will certainly seem like it&#39;s been a long day.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Anyone remotely familiar with the Robin Hood legend knows the basic story behind this parody. Robin (Cary Elwes) is the dashing hero who, along with his band of Merry Men (which includes members Will Scarlet O\&#39;Hara and Achoo the Moor), roams Sherwood Forest as the champion of the common people. His sworn enemy is the evil Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees), and his One True Love is Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck), she of the Everlast chastity belt. To win the heart and hand of Marian, Robin must defeat the Sheriff and his master, Prince John (Richard Lewis).\nImagine an amalgamation of THE NAKED GUN, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, and you have a pretty good idea what to expect from MEN IN TIGHTS. This is a film packed start-to-finish with satire, puns, one-liners, and other assorted visual and audile jokes. Nothing is too high-brow or low-brow for Mel Brooks, although you can bet there are more occurrences of earthy humor than that of the intellectual variety. Every opportunity for humor, no matter how feeble or juvenile, is seized upon.\nThere have been several parodies already this year (LOADED WEAPON ONE, HOT SHOTS: PART DEUX!, and LAST ACTION HERO come to mind), none of which have attained the level of MEN IN TIGHTS. That\&#39;s not to say that this is a masterpiece of any sort, but its jokes are more clever, more original, and more consistently funny than those in the other movies. In a HOT SHOTS-type film, the humor gets stale by the end of the first half-hour, and most of the laughs have dried up long before the final credits roll. Mel Brooks, on the other hand, has enough experience (not to mention flair) with this kind of motion picture, that he knows to vary the humor so that the gags don\&#39;t wear thin before the running time has expired.\nThat\&#39;s not to say that everything Brooks does works. There are a fair share of clunkers in MEN IN TIGHTS. But with such a non-stop barrage of jokes, regardless of what percentage work, there\&#39;s not much time in between laughs. And whether your kind of humor is along the lines of Shakespeare or Cheech and Chong, there\&#39;s something in this movie sure to provoke laughter.\nIn many ways, this is the Mel Brooks of old, the same master of humor that brought us classics like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and BLAZING SADDLES. MEN IN TIGHTS is not as original, inventive, or hilarious as those offerings, but it\&#39;s a reasonable offering and certainly not in the same dubious category as such Brooks duds like LIFE STINKS. In terms of scope, potential, and execution, this Robin Hood parody is along the lines of SPACEBALLS, the Brooks take-off on STAR WARS.\nThere\&#39;s a fairly strong element of MONTY PYTHON in this movie. While no one in their right mind would dare put this film on the same level as THE HOLY GRAIL, there are moments in MEN IN TIGHTS that the British comedy troupe would be proud of. Most notably, perhaps, is the rendition of the musical number, &#34;Men in Tights,&#34; which bears a passing resemblance to the Pythons\&#39; &#34;Lumberjack Song.&#34;\nIn a story that closely parallels the Kevin Costner account, Cary Elwes does his best Errol Flynn imitation--a fine job acting serious and swashbuckling amidst all the silliness around him. The other major players do reasonable jobs, from Roger Rees giving an over-the-top performance that couldn\&#39;t quite match that of Alan Rickman (from PRINCE OF THIEVES) to a too-subdued Amy Yasbeck.\nAs is frequently the case, those with cameos steal the show. Dom DeLuise shows up for one scene doing a superlative lampoon of Marlon Brando from THE GODFATHER. Patrick Stewart is on hand to imitate Sean Connery\&#39;s King Richard from PRINCE OF THIEVES. Not only does he strike as regal a figure as Connery, but he does an excellent job of mimicking the accent.\nThere are so many jokes in this movie that it\&#39;s difficult to pick out a memorable one or two. Among the more subtle ones, I was partial to the &#34;moving mole&#34; on Richard Lewis\&#39; face. Nearly every time we see Prince John, his rather sizeable mole has moved somewhere else. At one point, the Sheriff even feels compelled to mention this. Then there\&#39;s Mel Brooks as Rabbi Tuckman (instead of Friar Tuck), who gives &#34;half off&#34; circumcisions. Most of the overblown musical numbers are also fun, with obviously-dubbed singing voices and rappers fulfilling the function of a Greek Chorus.\nParodies are hard films to do, as the mediocre success of so many recent ones has shown. No matter how ripe a film or genre might be for mocking, unless you know how to do it, there are no guarantees. Fortunately for MEN IN TIGHTS, Mel Brooks has been doing this kind of thing for decades. As the ads say, &#34;The legend had it coming&#34;, and this film certainly dishes out all that the Merry Men can handle--and more.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Two twins, separated at birth, grow into adulthood never knowing each other, and living lives that evolve along very different paths. Freddy Ace (Matthew Modine) is a small-time gangster, a cold-hearted hit man and driver for local Mob boss Paris (Fred Ward). Freddy\&#39;s whole goal is getting ahead, and he has his eyes set on the top position. In contrast, Henry Petosa (also Modine) has almost no ambition whatsoever. He\&#39;s a shy, reclusive auto mechanic who has trouble relating to others, especially members of the opposite sex.\nI have no idea whether EQUINOX is a cleverly-devised satire on these kinds of &#34;identity movies,&#34; or whether it\&#39;s a bad melodramatic addition to the genre. This ambiguity in itself is not a good sign, since if the director was going for the parody, he should have done something to tip off the viewers. Instead, while we get a few hints that this might be the case, there are at least as many pointing to the other alternative.\nThe characters are all weird. Not &#34;weird&#34; in a delightful, quirky sense, but in a way that feels annoying. There\&#39;s no one to relate to, and writer/director Alan Rudolph doesn\&#39;t attempt to make any of his principals accessible to the audience. Freddy is cold-blooded and aloof, a man who feels like God after committing a murder. Henry is emotionally-crippled, unable to relate in normal social situations. His on-again, off-again girlfriend Beverly (Lara Flynn Boyle) is just as fragile. She\&#39;s frightened of sex and constantly refers to herself in the third person. The rest of the cast populating this movie is no more healthy.\nExcept in a few places where Rudolph makes it clear that he\&#39;s poking fun at something, the dialogue is atrocious. Most of the lines spoken by Henry sound scripted (rather than natural), and Freddy is constantly spitting out hard-boiled dialogue from a grade B detective flick. There are times when it\&#39;s almost painful to listen to these people speak.\nThe acting is uniformly unimpressive--ranging from pedestrian to downright bad. Matthew Modine, around whom the entire film revolves, does not do a good job. In pictures like GROSS ANATOMY and WIND, where he\&#39;s required to play an annoyingly cocky young man, he does a reasonably convincing job. Here, however, he overacts. He\&#39;s better as Freddy than Henry, but neither role is a masterpiece of subtlety, and it\&#39;s clear that his grasp of either character is limited.\nLara Flynn Boyle isn\&#39;t particularly impressive either. It seems that she, like Modine, felt a need to go over-the-top to show the emotional fragility of Beverly. There are a few instances when she\&#39;s on-target, but those are the exception rather than the rule. When she and Modine are together, it\&#39;s sometimes like a contest to see who can do the worst job.\nAs Henry\&#39;s neighbor Rosie the prostitute, Marisa Tomei uses her characteristically energetic style to overcome dramatic lapses in her performance. Her scenes (even though most of them include Modine) are the high points of this film. Contrast what she does to the hysteria of Lori Singer, whose half-dozen appearances as Freddy\&#39;s wife cause winces.\nA pair of normally-reliable actors, Fred Ward and M. Emmett Walsh, produce characters with flatter personalities than what they\&#39;re capable of, which opens up the question of how responsible the director is for the work of those acting in EQUINOX. Ward at least avoids embarrassing himself. Not so for Walsh, who is hideous as he goes way over-the-top.\nIt\&#39;s too bad that EQUINOX is so riddled with problems, because there\&#39;s a lot of soil here ripe for tilling. While there\&#39;s nothing new in the premise of twins with radically different personalities, this has a unique angle that, if produced more coherently, could have been the foundation for a genuinely worthwhile movie. Even given all the problems of EQUINOX, there\&#39;s something in the concept that encourages the viewer to stick with it, if for no other reason than to see what happens if and when the twins finally meet.\nActually, Henry\&#39;s life alone is worthy of a movie. Freddy isn\&#39;t a very interesting character, and there are few scenes with him that provoke more than a passing interest, but Henry has a fascinating life. His relationship with Rosie and her baby is sadly underdeveloped. More time is spent on his affair with Beverly, but there\&#39;s still a lot left unexplored. A few more scenes with these two might have helped the movie immensely.\nEQUINOX\&#39;s basic storyline is interesting enough to have held my interest for the one-hundred plus minutes. However, from the beginning, I was aware of how saturated with problems the film\&#39;s execution is. Beyond the initial draft of the plot skeleton, nothing appears to have been done right. Casting is dubious, scriptwriting sophomoric, and direction contributing to, rather than alleviating, faults.\nIf the viewer chooses to look at EQUINOX as a straight spoof, the movie still doesn\&#39;t work, although many of the worst scenes take on a less embarrassing tone. Given that perception, however, there\&#39;s too much that no longer makes sense, such as why there are so many dry, straight scenes, including an ending that\&#39;s designed to deliver a &#34;powerful&#34; message. This is a hard film to decipher, and one that\&#39;s not really worth the effort.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Despite his innocence, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) has been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. On the bus ride that takes him to the prison where he will spend the rest of his days, Kimble is accompanied by three other prisoners. When they stage an attempted escape, the driver of the bus loses control and it plunges down an embankment. Kimble is free. Ninety minutes later, Federal Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives on the scene to coordinate the search for the fugitive. So, while Kimble flees Gerard and his men, he begins his search for his wife\&#39;s real killer--a mysterious one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas).\nTHE FUGITIVE is loosely based on the 1960s television series which featured the late David Jansen in the title role. The film takes a lot of liberties with the original premise and characters, weaving a story that barely resembles the one which entertained TV audiences more than twenty years ago. Back then, Dr. Kimble was on the run for week after week, and there was more to each episode than the chase. Now, however, the flight lasts two hours, and catching the criminals is all that\&#39;s on anyone\&#39;s mind.\nOddly, even though THE FUGITIVE is an admitted chase movie, the scenes before the hunt begins are among the best of the movie. Everything surrounding the murder and trial, all told in a tremendously well-edited fifteen minute prologue, is engrossing. We don\&#39;t see much of the relationship between Richard and Helen Kimble, but what we\&#39;re presented with gives us insight into the double tragedy faced by the doctor. Not only is his beloved wife dead, but he\&#39;s the one believed by everyone to have killed her. Kimble\&#39;s character, revealed through these scenes, is well in place by the time his sentence is read.\nFollowing the opening scenes, we\&#39;re treated to over a half-hour of nonstop action as Gerard and his men go after Kimble. Well-photographed and directed with a flair, this part of the movie keeps viewers on the edges of their seats. Most importantly, when on the run, Kimble acts like an intelligent human being. Equally as refreshing, the lawmen are his match, not a bunch of uniformed dunces being run around in circles.\nIn fact, it could be argued that both Kimble and Gerard are too intelligent, not to mention too lucky. The plot is far from airtight, and there are a number of contrivances that come into play to bring about the resolution. How much of these you accept depends on how much license you\&#39;re willing to give the film makers. Considering the overall quality of the movie, I think they deserve some room to maneuver, and most of the plot hiccups didn\&#39;t bother me.\nThe movie\&#39;s pace flags somewhat during the second hour as the pursuit cools down and Kimble\&#39;s own search for the one armed man takes up screen time. There\&#39;s a little more talking and less action during the middle portion of the movie. Of course, the action predictably starts to build again as the closing moments arrive. The ending lacks originality but is nevertheless more satisfying than not.\nMost of THE FUGITIVE\&#39;s problems center around Kimble\&#39;s investigation of his wife\&#39;s murder. There are too many leaps of intuition and handily placed clues. The murder mystery is not well-constructed and there\&#39;s no way that the audience can figure out who\&#39;s responsible for the killing until the film reveals it (unless they use the old tried-and-true method of guessing based on who is among the least likely of suspects). Simplifying this part of the story might have resulted in a more tightly constructed plot, and a little less confusion about the motivation of some of the characters.\nPersonally, I wasn\&#39;t that interested in Kimble\&#39;s search. Sure, I wanted him to find the one armed man, but the lure of THE FUGITIVE is the cat-and-mouse chase between the doctor and Gerard. These moments are at the heart of the movie; they make the picture work because it\&#39;s through them that suspense is developed. Witness the scene at the dam--the tension as the two main characters confront each other is palpable. A little more of this Kimble/Gerard interplay might have put THE FUGITIVE squarely on the same level as another of the summer\&#39;s big thrillers, IN THE LINE OF FIRE.\nWith all apologies to Harrison Ford, who turns in a far more emotive and less wooden performance than in PATRIOT GAMES, the real acting standout is Tommy Lee Jones. For a man whose star has been on the rise for the past couple of years, this may be the movie that finally gets him into the upper echelon of today\&#39;s performers. He invests his character with charisma and energy and, as Gerard\&#39;s grudging respect for Kimble grows, so does our appreciation of what Jones is doing with his seemingly straightforward role. Assuming that Kimble is the good guy (which the script goes out of its way to make clear), that means that Gerard, who\&#39;s chasing him, is the bad guy. And, as the film progresses, we can\&#39;t help starting to like him.\nWhile no one could accuse THE FUGITIVE of having a masterful insight into human nature, that\&#39;s not why this film was produced. There\&#39;s an odd moment or two when an element of someone\&#39;s behavior strikes a responsive chord, but basically the characters are developed only enough to keep us interested in them as the chase proceeds. They, like the sometimes overplotted story, are subordinate to the hunt. Fans of the old TV series will find echoes of the show here, but most of this version is new. &#34;Innovative&#34; is not a legitimate description of THE FUGITIVE, but &#34;entertaining&#34; is.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Robert Townsend, Marla Gibbs, Robert Guillaume, James Earl Jones, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby Director: Robert Townsend Producer: Loretha C. Jones Screenplay: Robert Townsend Music: Cliff Eidelman Released by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer\nJefferson Reed (Robert Townsend) is the meekest of meek school teachers, living in a neighborhood that is rapidly being overrun by the Golden Lords, a drug-dealing and violence-loving gang. One night, however, Jefferson has an unexpected rendezvous with a green, glowing meteor. The collision imparts him with a number of superhuman powers, including the ability to see through solid objects, move with lightning-quick speed, and (of course) fly. The problem is that Jefferson\&#39;s basic personality is the same. He\&#39;s a reluctant superhero, not wanting the job of cleaning up the neighborhood. But as word gets out about &#34;Meteor Man&#34;, the Golden Lords intend to make sure that he doesn\&#39;t have a choice in the matter.\nTHE METEOR MAN is a mostly-unsatisfying film that can\&#39;t decide whether it wants to spoof superhero films or join their number. In attempting to walk a fine line between the two alternatives, it succeeds at neither. Actor/director/writer Robert Townsend has invested a lot of effort and energy into this production, but little of it is well-focused. Four editors worked on the film in post-production, and the final offering has the confused, choppy look of something put together by a committee.\nThere\&#39;s a message behind the silliness--you don\&#39;t have to be a superhero to stand up against the drug lords currently taking over our cities. If decent human beings band together, it doesn\&#39;t demand someone who can leap buildings to clean up the streets. It\&#39;s a worthwhile thing for a movie to say, but Townsend gets a little too preachy about it. Subtlety, at least in this case, is not one of THE METEOR MAN\&#39;s qualities.\nNormally in a movie of this kind, you don\&#39;t worry too much about characterization. However, when Townsend decides to introduce dramatic elements into his story, the film comes to need men and women who are more than comic-book caricatures. They aren\&#39;t there, however. There isn\&#39;t anyone in this movie that simulates a real human being. Even Townsend\&#39;s Jefferson, with by far the greatest screen time of anyone, fails to display more than a couple of carefully-contrived emotions.\nSome elements of the storyline are annoying. It\&#39;s impossible to explain why, after discovering his superpowers, Jefferson doesn\&#39;t go out immediately and get rid of the bad guys. In fact, his father (played by Robert Guillaume) advises that he do just that. But Jefferson dawdles around while his mother makes him a costume, occasionally knocking off a few token Golden Lords and letting the running time of the film move towards acceptable motion picture levels. The entire manner in which Meteor Man confronts the villains is inexplicable. A battle that should be one-sided and quickly ended turns into a an all-out war with the superhero made into the underdog by a plot contrivance.\nThere are a few funny scenes in the film, and at least one running gag that works (look at James Earl Jones\&#39; always-changing wigs). Towards the end, positioned right in the middle of the climactic battle between Jefferson and the leader of the Golden Lords, is a truly hilarious moment that, despite its odd placement, is worth mentioning. If THE METEOR MAN had boasted more such scenes, it would have been far less tiresome to watch.\nNo one can deny that Robert Townsend had good intentions when he put THE METEOR MAN together, but the final product doesn\&#39;t have consistency or coherence. With its positive message and lack of serious violence, this is a reasonable choice for a children\&#39;s film, but something of a lame offering for adults. There\&#39;s not enough of any one element--comedy, satire, drama, or action--and the mixture isn\&#39;t any more palatable than the individual ingredients. THE METEOR MAN is a superhero movie that lacks punch.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Miho Nikaido, Tenmei Kano, Sayoko Amano Director: Ryu Murakami Producers: Yoshitaka Suzuki, Tadanobu Hirao, and Yosuke Nagata Screenplay: Ryu Murakami Music: Ryuichi Sakamoto Released by Northern Arts Entertainment Japanese with English Subtitles\nAi (Miho Nikaido) is a Japanese callgirl specializing in domination and bondage. When we first meet her, she\&#39;s nearly naked and spreadeagled with restraints holding down her arms and legs. Meanwhile, her client, after whispering to her that she should trust him, blindfolds and gags her before forcibly injecting her with heroin. Welcome to the world of TOKYO DECADENCE, where prostitution is a dangerous and ugly profession, not the thing of romance it has been portrayed as in Hollywood\&#39;s sanitized PRETTY WOMAN.\nAi doesn\&#39;t have the personality to be a prostitute. Not only is she shy, but she\&#39;s a romantic. In fact, she once fell in love with a client who treated her gently--something someone in her position isn\&#39;t used to. Unlike Richard Gere, however, this man was interested in her for one night only. After that, he didn\&#39;t care what happened to her.\nAi is looking for happiness, and finding it hard to come by. She consults a fortune teller who informs her that to get her wish she has to do three things: put a telephone book under her television set, stay away from museums in the eastern part of the city, and wear a ring with a pink stone on her middle finger. Ai is so desperate that she follows these instructions to the letter. Of course, they don\&#39;t help. For someone mired in her situation, there don\&#39;t seem to be any solutions.\nTOKYO DECADENCE is a gut-wrenching and horrifying look at the world of prostitution. Equally, it\&#39;s a condemnation of the seedy, secret side of Japanese society that is kept hidden from the outside world. The problems illustrated in the movie are not unique to that country, however. Decadence is a human condition, and where men and women are, there too will be the ugliness shown in this picture.\nThose who feel that RISING SUN is guilty of Japan-bashing may be very disturbed by the impressions presented by TOKYO DECADENCE. Perhaps because it\&#39;s made by Japanese film makers primarily for a Japanese-speaking audience, the producers felt no need to pull punches. Writer/director Ryu Murakami\&#39;s theme can be summarized in one sentence from the movie: &#34;It\&#39;s Japan that\&#39;s wealthy, but it\&#39;s wealth without pride.&#34; Psychologists have always talked of how powerful men have a need to be dominated--Murakami has applied this to the collective psyche of an entire country.\nThe sex in this film, while abundant and explicit, is definitely not erotic. Viewers are more likely to be sickened than titillated. Murakami didn\&#39;t make this film to tickle people\&#39;s libidos; he wanted to bring out the potential ugliness that can come through sex. In that, he has succeeded abundantly. TOKYO DECADENCE is graphic but not gratuitous, and I can\&#39;t go into details about some of the humiliation that Ai is put through without proof that the reader of this review is over eighteen.\nTOKYO DECADENCE is so bleak that without the inclusion of a brief scene designed primarily for comic relief, this would have been as close to unbearable a movie as I have ever seen. As is often true of cautionary tales, the stuff of TOKYO DECADENCE is too strong for mere entertainment.\nThat having been said, there is still a story with characters. Of all the people we meet, only Ai attains depth, but she is brilliantly fleshed-out by the script and portrayed by actress Miho Nikaido, who has to put a lot of herself on the line to appear in some of TOKYO DECADENCE\&#39;s scenes. Few performers are willing to expose themselves to this much humiliation and degradation--even if it is only on film--to bring a character to life.\nFor most of the movie, the plot is reasonable, if not overly-involving. Until the end, that is, when it all comes crashing down. Often, movies conclude with let-downs, but in the case of TOKYO DECADENCE, there\&#39;s a complete collapse. The last twenty minutes are so poorly put together that they\&#39;re virtually not worth sitting through. The drawn-out finale is tedious, and seriously damaged my overall impression of the movie. Five minutes would have been more than enough time to bang home Murakami\&#39;s final point.\nProduction-wise, the picture is a mixed bag. The musical score is poor, sounding like a badly-synthesized composition lifted directly from some cheap 1970s American flick. The cinematography is equally of dubious quality. In attempting to highlight the dispiriting nature of the film, many of the scenes were shot in conditions of low lighting. Unfortunately, sometimes things are so dark that it\&#39;s difficult to figure out what\&#39;s going on.\nTOKYO DECADENCE is a movie that will appeal only to a select few. Strong stomachs and a willingness to see almost anything are requisite. The movie is rated NC-17 for a reason. Those who take a chance on this film may be disappointed by some of what it has to offer, but the overall experience won\&#39;t soon be forgotten.\n&#39;,
 &#34;For twelve years, Johnny Dingle (Andrew Lowery) has been hopelessly in love with Missy McCloud (Traci Lind). Now, with the approach of the Senior Prom, Johnny finally gets up the courage to ask Missy out. Unfortunately, before he has the opportunity, he&#39;s killed in a convenience store robbery. But never fear! Not even death can hold back Johnny and, despite the annoying tendency of several of his body parts to fall off, he returns from the grave to go to the prom with Missy. Surprisingly enough, she&#39;s a lot more attracted to him now that he&#39;s dead than she ever was while he was alive (I guess he gets points for being unusual).\nThose expecting this to be an unapologetically silly movie are right on the money. However, as idiotic as it is, MY BOYFRIEND&#39;S BACK is not without a few redeeming qualities. Much like last year&#39;s BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, there are enough clever touches to the film to keep it from becoming tedious or unwatchable. I would never argue that MY BOYFRIEND&#39;S BACK is a good movie, nor would I recommend it to anyone, but it&#39;s not nearly as awful as the title would suggest, and there are at least a few worse pictures available at the moment.\nOne of the primary problems with this film is that while it has a fun, lighthearted tone, it isn&#39;t nearly funny enough. Far too many jokes fall flat, and those that do succeed are more likely to provoke an amused smirk than any genuine laughter. The premise is somewhat underused, at least as far as humor goes.\nMY BOYFRIEND&#39;S BACK is pretty good at self-parody, though. The nonchalant way that everyone treats Johnny&#39;s return is clever and enjoyable to watch. Nothing that happens seems to shock anyone; they take it all in stride. In fact, Missy is flattered that a guy would do something like come back from the dead for her.\nJohnny&#39;s mother (Mary Beth Hurt) and father (Edward Herrmann) are especially farcical. They are proud of their son&#39;s achievement, but determined to do everything necessary to keep things normal. When it turns out that Johnny needs to eat living flesh to keep him from decaying, his mother goes to the store and picks up a stray kid in case he wants a snack. When the neighbors threaten to burn Johnny, Mom pulls out a gun and aims it in their direction.\nThere is an anti-racist, anti-prejudice message that doesn&#39;t work. I recognize that the people behind MY BOYFRIEND&#39;S BACK are trying to do something positive, but comparing the plight of the undead--a truly ridiculous situation to begin with--to the bigotry faced by many minorities is more than just a bad idea; it&#39;s insensitive. I can even see where some might find it downright offensive.\nIt&#39;s surprising how good the cast is. They do their jobs in the right spirit, giving excellent, deadpan (no pun intended) performances that keep this film from going into cardiac arrest. How fine actors like Mary Beth Hurt and Edward Herrmann can keep straight faces through these proceedings is difficult to conceive. Andrew Lowery&#39;s Johnny may be the star of the show, but they steal the spotlight.\nOne inventive touch found in the movie serves to emphasize the comic-book quality of the story. Many of the scenes are started with cartoon panels that turn into live-action sequences. Director Bob Balaban has fun blending fantasy, comedy, and parody together, and does a surprisingly smooth job of it. If only his script had more bite, this could have been a worthwhile film.\nAs it is, MY BOYFRIEND&#39;S BACK is about as mindless as a movie can get. That&#39;s not always a bad thing to say about a film, but it certainly isn&#39;t an heartfelt endorsement. Maybe when it comes on cable, it will be worth a look--that&#39;s about the right medium for something of this sort. MY BOYFRIEND&#39;S BACK has its moments, just not enough of them.\nThis review is copyright 1993 by James Berardinelli\n&#34;,
 &#39;Starring: Max Pomeranc, Joe Mantegna, Joan Allen, Ben Kingsley, Laurence Fishburne Director: Steven Zaillian Producers: Scott Rudin and William Horberg Screenplay: Steven Zaillian based on the book by Fred Waitzkin Music: James Horner Released by Paramount Pictures\nAt the tender age of seven, Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc) becomes fascinated by the game of chess. Without giving up Little League baseball, he learns how to play, hanging out with Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne) and a group of speed chess hustlers who occupy nearby Washington Square. It isn\&#39;t long before Josh is able to beat them all. His father, looking to take him to the next level, employs ex-chess master Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley) as a teacher. Under Pandolfini, Josh matures as a player and, for the first time, he starts to fear losing.\nSEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is based on the true life story of Josh Waitzkin who, at the age of sixteen, is currently the highest-ranked American player under eighteen. It isn\&#39;t just Josh\&#39;s tale, however. The name and image of the mysterious chess genius Bobby Fischer infiltrate this movie. Fischer is as much an icon to this game as Babe Ruth is to baseball.\nHow important are games to the American way of life? Have they become so crucial that we lose sight of the people playing them? And at what point does the need to win become so important that the game ceases to be fun?\nThese are some of the questions that SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER probes. It certainly can\&#39;t answer them (since there are no definitive solutions), but the film offers fodder for thought as it explores Josh\&#39;s early career and examines the relationship between the young chess master and his sports writer father, Frank Waitzkin.\nJosh starts playing chess because it fascinates him. As soon as Frank recognizes his son\&#39;s gift, however, he begins to apply subtle pressure. Winning becomes important--perhaps too important--and Josh is afraid that to fail at the game is to risk losing his father\&#39;s love. It\&#39;s then that chess becomes a burden and he stops enjoying it.\nJosh has two mentors--the street-smart Vinnie, who teaches him to play the opponent, not the board; and Bruce Pandolfini, a man who has suffered an unspecified loss in an unnamed competition, but knows the game inside out. Each has a different perspective to offer, and Josh learns from them both. One lesson, however, he is unable to take to heart--he cannot hate his opponents, no matter how much they despise him.\nWe never learn exactly what demons haunt Pandolfini, and it\&#39;s a credit to this film that it doesn\&#39;t make them explicit. There are enough clues that they can be guessed at, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER relies upon the intelligence of its audience to put the pieces together.\nThere are four key relationships in this film, each of which is explored with varying success. Even the weakest, that of Josh and his mother (Joan Allen), has an emotional depth unusual for the amount of screen time accorded to it. Of all the adults in the film, only Bonnie Waitzkin never loses sight of what\&#39;s best for her son.\nAlso treated in a cursory fashion is the unusual friendship that develops between Josh and Vinnie. It\&#39;s clear that the two are fond of each other, and Vinnie\&#39;s tactics become important to Josh\&#39;s development as a player, but we don\&#39;t see enough of the two of them together to get a genuine sense of the mutual respect that grows between them.\nPerhaps the most complex relationship is that of Josh and his father. While Frank never stops loving his son, there comes a point when Josh\&#39;s winning becomes more important to him than to his son. This kind of pressure is too much to put on a young boy, no matter how gifted he is, and it takes a threat by Bonnie to make this clear and put the situation in perspective.\nAlso explored in some detail are Josh\&#39;s interactions with Bruce Pandolfini. Like Frank, Pandolfini loses sight of his young charge\&#39;s innocence and age, and tries to mold him into a chess-playing machine. In some sense, Pandolfini is perhaps attempting to fight the ghosts of his past through Josh. It isn\&#39;t until the end of the film that he is finally able to accept and love his student for who he is.\nBen Kingsley and Joe Mantegna do excellent jobs bringing their characters to life. These are men with faults, but it\&#39;s those imperfections that enable us to empathize with them. Neither actor has an overabundance of screen time with which to develop a personality, but good performers can do quite a bit with an economy of scenes. Having only a handful of appearances, Laurence Fishburne faces an even more difficult challenge, but he nevertheless manages to convince us that he\&#39;s a true friend to Josh, concerned more about the boy\&#39;s happiness than his success. Joan Allen, despite often being relegated to the background, gives a convincing portrayal of a mother who cares so much about her son\&#39;s well-being that she\&#39;s willing to take him away from his father, if necessary, to assure it.\nWhen casting SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, the production team decided that instead of choosing a young &#34;name&#34; actor who might know little or nothing about chess, they would choose someone who was a chess player first and an actor second. Realism was important to the film makers--they wanted chess-playing viewers to be spared the indignity of watching someone faking playing the game.\nIn Max Pomeranc, an excellent choice was made. Not only is he an experienced (as experienced one can be at that young age) chess player, but he acquits himself admirably in the role of Josh. He\&#39;s not the best child actor to grace the screen, but he avoids the awkward obviousness of many.\nSEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is an intensely fascinating movie capable of involving those who are ignorant about chess as well as those who love it. The focus of the film is less on the actual game than it is on the people, emotions, and pressures surrounding Josh. It is a tale of human trials and triumph, not a sports movie that panders to a certain segment of the population. Chess may not be the most exciting activity to watch, but SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER makes for engaging entertainment.\nOne final note: even though this film might seem like a perfect family movie with its lack of violence, profanity, and sex, I would caution parents considering taking their children to SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER. With its focus on character development and drama, many younger viewers will likely become quickly bored. This is an &#34;adult&#34; movie ill-suited to those with short attention spans.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Charles Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard, Tom Sizemore, Elisabeth Shue Director: Ron Underwood Producer: Nancy Roberts and Sean Daniel Screenplay: Brent Maddock, S.S. Wilson, Gregory Hansen, and Erik Hansen Music: Marc Shaiman Released by Universal Pictures\nOne night in 1959, four people (Charles Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard, and Tom Sizemore) board a city bus in San Francisco, each suffering a major life crisis. They are never given a chance to solve their problems because the bus crashes and all on board are killed. However, instead of being assumed into heaven (or the other place, as the case may be), they find themselves stuck on earth as the &#34;imaginary friends&#34; of just-born Thomas Reilly (who grows up to be Robert Downey, Jr.). When it becomes apparent that the quartet are seriously warping Thomas\&#39; personality (he talks to people that no one else can see), they decide to fade from sight and leave him on his own. The separation isn\&#39;t permanent, though. Twenty years later, they reappear to straighten out Thomas\&#39; life, as well as to set their own personal ghosts to rest, before they are whisked away to inhabit new bodies.\nThe above description attempts to capture some of the nuances of a needlessly-convoluted and poorly-conceived storyline that someone should have had the intelligence to pare down to reasonable levels. HEART AND SOULS, as is often the case with films scripted by four people, is at odds with itself, frequently not seeming to know where to go next and, on those occasions when it has a set direction, proceeding in the most confused and unsatisfying manner possible.\nFor nearly fifty years, film makers have been trying to recapture the drama and magic of Frank Capra\&#39;s 1946 American classic IT\&#39;S A WONDERFUL LIFE. To this date, no one has succeeded. HEART AND SOULS is yet another stab in the dark, and not only does it fail, but it turns out to be worse than many of the efforts before it. In retrospect, it\&#39;s hard to find many good things to say about this movie.\nThe thing about IT\&#39;S A WONDERFUL LIFE is that it took its time developing the character of its protagonist, George Bailey. Not until the final quarter of the movie does the supernatural intervention occur. In HEART AND SOULS, while approximately a half-hour is spent setting the story up, there are too many characters to flesh out. None of them are sufficiently fleshed out, and the rest of the movie ends up falling flat because of it. Character identification is crucial in a film of this nature and, when it doesn\&#39;t happen, the picture is doomed.\nFrom start to finish, the script consciously and mechanically tries to manipulate the audience to laughter and tears. Partially as a result of being too obvious about its intentions and partially because of heavy-handed direction, it doesn\&#39;t succeed. Most of the jokes aren\&#39;t very funny and the scenes designed to strum the heart strings are more embarrassing that touching. When a rapport hasn\&#39;t been developed between the characters and the audience, attempts to make us cry can end up looking rather silly.\nHEART AND SOULS has a fine cast, which is why it\&#39;s surprising that the acting is so lackluster. I suppose part of the blame can go to the behind-the-scenes team that &#34;crafted&#34; this dud, but the performers can\&#39;t be absolved of all blame. Of the major participants, only Tom Sizemore does a reasonable job. Robert Downey, Jr., relies too much on what he did in CHAPLIN (whenever one of the spirits enters his body he gives a Tramp-like lurch). Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard, and Charles Grodin are flat, and Elisabeth Shue displays all the range of a water pistol. David Paymer, who was decent in Billy Crystal\&#39;s MR. SATURDAY NIGHT, manages to be incredibly tedious in a small role as the bus driver.\nThere are a few energetic scenes that save this production from being an utter debacle. Chief among these is a concert given by B. B. King (appearing as himself) where Thomas, under the influence of Charles Grodin\&#39;s Harrison Winslow, gives a throbbing rendition of the &#34;Star Spangled Banner.&#34; There are also a few mildly humorous interludes with a police officer, although the conclusion of that particular subplot is laughably bad.\nFor all of its attempts to weave a spell on the audience, HEART AND SOULS manages to be annoyingly blatant in what it\&#39;s trying to do. Nevertheless, if you\&#39;re someone who drools over happy endings, this may be the movie for you (provided you can stomach the film\&#39;s many other shortcomings). It doesn\&#39;t just have one of these, but five, each more cloying than the one before. A rare treat for those who don\&#39;t mind going into sugar shock.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: John D. LeMay, Kari Keegan, Erin Gray, Steven Williams Director: Adam Marcus Producer: Sean S. Cunningham Screenplay: Dean Lorey and Jay Hugely, based on the story by Hugely and Adam Marcus Music: Harry Manfredini Released by New Line Cinema\nThis may be a first: a movie title that gives away the ending of the film. Come to think of it, some of the other FRIDAY THE 13TH films did the same thing, didn\&#39;t they? Actually, they lied. Any bets about this one?\nIt\&#39;s the dark of the night at Camp Crystal Lake and some stupid girl who didn\&#39;t watch any of the other FRIDAY THE 13TH movies is taking her clothes off. What better (and more obvious) prelude to the arrival of Jason for his ninth resurrection. After failing to skewer or behead his victim on the first try, he chases her through the woods before finally cornering her in an apparently empty clearing. Oops. Jason has made a mistake. His prey is actually a plant (not of the flowering variety, although the performance is a bit wooden) and he\&#39;s suddenly surrounded by military-type men with all kinds of firepower. Fourth of July! It doesn\&#39;t take long before the killer is a mound of burnt up organs. It looks like it\&#39;s all over. That is, until the coroner takes too close a look at Jason\&#39;s oversized heart. Now you and I both know that was a dumb move.\nSurprise, surprise! This film will not make my bottom ten list of the year. In fact, it won\&#39;t come close. Despite a legacy of horrible previous efforts under the FRIDAY THE 13TH umbrella (of which I have seen only three--parts 1, 2, and 8--all on cable), this film actually has a few good elements buried amidst all the dead bodies, dumb dialogue, and mystical nonsense. Chief among these is that JASON GOES TO HELL has chosen to turn the series in the direction of open self-parody.\nThis movie doesn\&#39;t take itself seriously--at least not too seriously. In between the various maimings, it takes time out to poke fun at the series\&#39; reputation, including a reference to going up to Camp Crystal Lake to &#34;do drugs, have premarital sex, and get slaughtered&#34;. It\&#39;s this warped sense of humor that actually makes the film somewhat entertaining. In a genre where it\&#39;s often difficult to tell satires from serious attempts, the parodies in JASON GOES TO HELL are far too obvious to be accidental.\nOf course, horror fans won\&#39;t be disappointed. There are the requisite jump-out-of-your-seat-scares (complete with a burst of over-the-top music), not to mention a high body count. Actually, in terms of showing the gruesome deeds, JASON GOES TO HELL is pretty tame. Sure, there are a lot of shots of organs and blood, but most of the murders happen off screen. You know how the people are slaughtered, but you aren\&#39;t subjected to watching the details.\nIn the end, Jason gets his--again. But is he really dead this time? Despite the assertion that if he\&#39;s skewered by one of his relatives, he\&#39;s finally gone, I somehow doubt that. Unless this film runs a serious financial deficit--which seems unlikely given the opening weekend turnout--Jason will be back. In fact, we\&#39;re even given a substantial clue about his next cinematic adventure.\nAfter the disappointing lack of success of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART EIGHT, Paramount Pictures, the previous distributor of these films, gave up on the series. New Line Cinema quickly snatched up the rights. The executives had a great idea for a crossover now that they owned Jason and Freddy Krueger. My question is, why not try to get Michael Meyers (the killer from the HALLOWEEN series, not the guy who should be axed for foisting SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER on us)? Then there could be a real gathering of the Who\&#39;s Who of Maniacs. As of now, however, clues point to it being just Jason and Freddy. Oh well.\nMake no mistake from any slight praise that I might give this film--it is in no way a good movie. Seeing it with the right rowdy audience while not spending money on it (if I hadn\&#39;t gotten in for free, I wouldn\&#39;t have seen this film) makes Jason\&#39;s latest apparition bearable. For anyone who is even luke-warm about this genre, don\&#39;t take this as a recommendation to see the film. But for blood-and-guts lovers everywhere, the return of Jason is reason enough to trundle down to the local multiplex for a midnight showing. After all, you wouldn\&#39;t dare consider seeing this movie during the day!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Starring: Kate Maberly, Heydon Prowse, Andrew Knott, Maggie Smith, John Lynch Director: Agnieszka Holland Producers Fred Fuchs, Fred Roos, and Tom Luddy Screenplay: Caroline Thompson based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett Music: Zbigniew Preisner Released by Warner Brothers\nOrphaned in India, where her transplanted English parents lived before falling victim to an earthquake, Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly) comes to the cold, aloof household of her uncle, the widower of her mother&#39;s twin sister. There she is viewed as nothing short of a meddlesome nuisance by the housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith), and is ordered to stay in her room until told to come out. Mary doesn&#39;t obey, of course, and in her explorations discovers the room of her sickly cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse), from whom she is intentionally being kept. Outside, she finds something even more wondrous: the secret garden of her late aunt. With the help of Dickon (Andrew Knott), a local boy who can talk with animals, Mary sets to work reclaiming the garden from the weeds and brambles that had overrun it.\nTHE SECRET GARDEN has at least two things going for it: remarkable acting and mesmerizing cinematography (by Roger Deakins). Even without much of a story, this film could stand alone on those two qualities. It&#39;s amazing to find a child, especially one as young as Kate Maberly (who, at the age of ten, has already been in numerous BBC TV productions), capable of carrying a film. And Maberly isn&#39;t all sugar-and-spice. Her Mary has plenty of bitterness, disdain, and arrogance to make her virtually unbearable at times.\nMaggie Smith, always the consummate professional, is excellent as the nasty housekeeper. Mrs. Medlock isn&#39;t all bad, however, even though her few moments of humanity could hardly be called heartwarming. Her real motives, while frequently pursued in the most misguided and warped of methods, are nevertheless good and true. Her dislike of Mary comes as much from a perception of the danger that the young girl could present to Colin Craven as from the sudden injection of randomness into a previously well-ordered existence.\nTHE SECRET GARDEN is based on Frances Hodgson Burnett&#39;s 1911 novel, and director Agnieszka Holland (recently at the helm for EUROPA, EUROPA and OLIVIER, OLIVIER) has taken care that the screenplay follow the book. Ms. Holland is an avowed fan of the story, having read it over and over again as a child. The care and effort she poured into this, her first Hollywood effort, is proof enough of that. She has created a picture that is magical for viewers of all ages.\nThe story is essentially about the redemption of two damaged children. Mary, while hale of body, is an emotional cripple. She grew up unloved in a household where her selfish parents handed her off to the servants. Colin is neither physically nor emotionally whole. His father, never having recovered from the death of his wife, rarely visits Colin in the sickroom, leaving the boy&#39;s care to the implacable and unaffectionate Mrs. Medlock.\nThe secret garden is a place of rare and wondrous beauty, and it becomes the emotional balm that heals all wounds, both physical and psychological. There, Mary learns how to feel and Colin how to walk. These two form a fast friendship both with each other and with Dickon, the younger brother of one of Mrs. Medlock&#39;s maids.\nTHE SECRET GARDEN combines drama, fantasy, and a little bit of light Gothic horror (the old house with its strange noises) into a satisfying mix. The film is a visual feast, from the eerie insides of Misselthwaite Manor to the time-lapse photography of blooming flowers. Zbigniew Preisner&#39;s score adds to the atmosphere without ever becoming obvious or intrusive.\nI&#39;m not sure how some younger viewers will react to this film. Most of them will miss the subtle nuances that Agnieszka Holland brings to the screen (which are aimed at adults), but the story, centering as it does around children, will be enough to captivate many. Obviously, THE SECRET GARDEN is not an action film, and those weaned on that genre are likely to find this production stale. Nevertheless, it is an excellent family film for those willing to immerse themselves in its leisurely pace--the picture proceeds just fast enough to keep the audience&#39;s attention while exhibiting a great attention to detail. THE SECRET GARDEN has something to offer everyone, and that&#39;s a rarity among movies these days.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Andy (Steve Parlavecchio), Trevor (Patrick McGaw), and Billy (Joseph Lindsey) have grown up together in the Long Island community of Five Towns. By their own admission, their friendship started almost from birth. However, relationships that were once strong begin to fracture with the onset of adulthood. A drug bust gone bad sends Trevor to prison and he emerges a disillusioned man. Billy becomes a big-time hood using Andy as his gopher, a role that the somewhat-timid twenty-three year old is desperate to escape from.\nAMONGST FRIENDS is another story about crime in America, but instead of telling about the &#34;have nots&#34; of society, the film focuses on three boys who come from wealthy, respectable families. Bored and satisfied with comfortable lives where all their conventional wants are met, they crave something different and exciting. Andy\&#39;s grandfather, who built his fortune as a bookie, and his gangster friends become inspirations and role models.\nThe three main characters couldn\&#39;t be more different. Trevor is a dreamer and a romantic, a man to whom freedom and love mean more than all the money in the world. His feelings for Laura (Mira Sorvino, daughter of GOODFELLAS actor Paul Sorvino) bring him back to Five Towns following a lengthy absence, and it\&#39;s his return that sets in motion the events of this film.\nBilly is, plain and simple, a thoroughly unlikable bully. In fact, if there\&#39;s an obvious flaw in any of the characters, it\&#39;s that he has absolutely no redeeming characteristics. It\&#39;s hard to see what anyone else could possibly see in someone so completely despicable.\nOf the three, Andy is the most unsatisfied with life. Each of his friends has something while he\&#39;s still striving for that one big score that will fill the gaping void. It isn\&#39;t that he needs the money--he can get that from his parents any time he wants it--but the cash is a way of proving that he can hit the big time, even if it is gained through drug deals.\nSolid performances by the lead actors, not to mention strong support from a cast of equally-unfamiliar names, bring these people to life. Through the entire film, there\&#39;s not a bad acting job to be found, and a couple of the players excel. Patrick McGaw is superlative, as is Mira Sorvino, despite the limitations of the role. Also worthy of note is Ms. Sorvino\&#39;s grandfather, Ford Sorvino, who has a series of hilarious cameos that provide most of the film\&#39;s scarce comic relief. Apparently, there\&#39;s a lot of talent in that family.\nAMONGST FRIENDS never lets up. Scene after scene flashes by, often moving the plot along at dizzying speeds. Movies less economic with dialogue and story development might take an hour longer to tell the same tale. The transitions in AMONGST FRIENDS are frequently abrupt, and writer/director Rob Weiss obviously doesn\&#39;t believe in wasting screen time.\nIn fact, it could be argued that the film moves too fast, especially at the beginning when it takes a while to sort out who the individual characters are and exactly what they\&#39;re up to. The voiceover narrative by Andy doesn\&#39;t help much since there\&#39;s too much information to absorb in such a short time.\nThis is one of those low-budget motion pictures (it cost only $900,000 to make) that succeeds wildly because it takes chances. Eschewing formulas is dangerous territory for a production team that wants their product to hit it big; fortunately, there\&#39;s still a market for this kind of small, independently-made movie. Apparently the big distribution companies know something good when they see it, though, because Weiss has recently signed a three picture deal with Universal.\nDon\&#39;t look for easy answers in AMONGST FRIENDS, because you won\&#39;t find them. In fact, the film doesn\&#39;t really offer any solutions. The problems are obvious, as are the tragic consequences of certain actions, but if Weiss has any answers, he doesn\&#39;t share them with us.\nIn the final analysis, AMONGST FRIENDS works not because it\&#39;s an expose of upscale, suburban violence and drug use, but because it takes the time to develop its characters so that the events which swirl around them involve us. Emotional honesty is difficult for many films, but this one attains it, and when something devastating happens on screen, the reverberations shake the theater and the people sitting in it.\nThat\&#39;s the kind of experience that AMONGST FRIENDS offers. It\&#39;s not safe, comfortable, or lighthearted, nor is it completely original, but it\&#39;s definitely memorable. With plenty of movies available offering fluff, this is among the rare exceptions that don\&#39;t pull punches and always hit hard.\n&#39;,
 &#39;What happens when a bored wife thinks her kindly old neighbor commits a murder? Woody Allen attempts to answer the question in his latest cinematic endeavor, MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY.\nCarol Lipton (Diane Keaton) and her husband Larry (Woody Allen) are caught in a routine, commonplace marriage - until Carol turns into Nancy Drew following the death of a neighbor. It all seems like a open-and- shut case of a heart attack, and the police aren\&#39;t thinking foul play, but Carol becomes suspicious when the widower of the dead woman (Jerry Adler) doesn\&#39;t mourn &#34;enough&#34; (&#34;What should he do&#34;, asks Larry, &#34;walk down the street sobbing?&#34;). With the help of Ted (Alan Alda), a close friend who encourages her sleuthing, she begins to assemble &#34;clues&#34; to fit her pet theory of a murder. But the evidence is weak, and Larry becomes concerned that his wife is obsessed with a macabre fantasy. He tries to be the voice of reason, but when no one listens to him, he ends up playing along.\nPart of the fun of MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY is guessing whether or not Lillian House was murdered, as Carol believes, or simply died of a heart attack. In a sense, that\&#39;s the mystery of the film, and Woody Allen brings across the solution with his characteristic mix of madcap comedy and on-target realism.\nIn 1979, director Allen made MANHATTAN, a movie that many critics and fans consider to be his greatest effort. Between then and now, Diane Keaton has been absent from Allen\&#39;s films, and her return in MURDER MYSTERY is a welcome change from helium-voiced Mia Farrow. Ms. Keaton is a breezy, energetic personality, and it\&#39;s hard to imagine anyone else doing nearly as much with the character of Carol (even though this part was originally conceived with Farrow in mind, and wasn\&#39;t re-written following the cast change). One need only look at the Allen/Keaton and Allen/Farrow collaborations to determine which pairing worked better, and MURDER MYSTERY merely reinforces this conclusion.\nSome claim that to have seen one Woody Allen picture is to have seen them all. To say that not only vastly oversimplifies things, but does a great injustice to the individuality of each of Allen\&#39;s projects. Sure, there are a number of themes that he returns to like a comfortable chair, and the character he plays rarely varies from a basic neurotic type (no one would accuse Allen of having great range as an actor), but each of his films - even those that fail (take SHADOWS AND FOG, for instance) - offers something fresh and unique.\nHUSBANDS AND WIVES, Allen\&#39;s previous picture, is a drama with humorous elements. MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY is closer to a straightforward comedy, providing more laughs than anything Allen has done in a long while (he claims to have &#34;indulged&#34; himself with this movie). Combined with numerous one-liners, almost all of which work, are several instances of well-timed and well-executed physical humor. Allen pushes all the buttons from wit to slapstick, and rarely comes up empty.\nIf there\&#39;s a serious side to MURDER MYSTERY, it\&#39;s only to be expected. After all, the director has a reputation to maintain, and the movie\&#39;s principal subject - death - isn\&#39;t usually a laugh-a-minute riot. Allen also takes a look at love, as the twenty-year marriage of Carol and Larry is put under the microscope.\nFilm buffs will find the usual number of references to look for, although these are perhaps more explicit than in many Allen movies, and include DOUBLE INDEMNITY, REAR WINDOW, and THE LADY FROM SHANGHI. There certainly may be others, as Allen has a habit of putting more into his films than anyone can hope to get in one sitting.\nA word has to be said about the annoying cinematography of Carlo Di Palma, who returns after causing audiences motion-sickness with his wobbly, hand-held camerawork in HUSBANDS AND WIVES. While the intention is obviously to draw the viewer into the film, it actually has the opposite effect; the camera cannot compensate the way the human eye can. Admittedly, this method seems less distracting here than in the previous film, although this could be a case of greater exposure breeding immunity.\nWoody Allen is rarely a big commercial draw, and whether his off-screen antics will boost his box-office take remains to be seen, but MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY may be his most accessible film since HANNAH AND HER SISTERS. This movie is still pure Allen, but the humor is broad-based, and the &#34;quirkiness&#34; often associated with the director is kept to a minimum. Frankly, it\&#39;s been years since I\&#39;ve enjoyed Woody Allen this much.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Take a deep breath and prepare to suspend your disbelief, because in bringing us this summer\&#39;s first (and probably only) pure action film, Jean-Claude Van Damme and John Woo have given new meaning to the word &#34;preposterous.&#34;\nChance Boudreaux (Van Damme) is a down-on-his-luck ex-merchant marine who got blacklisted after dumping a drug-smuggling captain overboard. Now, he\&#39;s forced to eek out a living doing whatever odd jobs he can find on the docks and streets of New Orleans. One day, he spies a lady in distress (Yancy Butler) and, using his rather impressive kick-boxing techniques, rescues her from a gang of would-be muggers (and rapists?). In return, she offers him a job: help her find her father, a homeless vet who has disappeared. What Natasha and Chance\&#39;s search turns up, however, turns out to be a dark and deadly secret that makes them the prey in a vicious cat-and-mouse game run by the evil and ruthless Fouchon (Lance Henriksen).\nHARD TARGET is, in essence, an example of the victory of style over substance. When it comes to the &#34;typical&#34; criteria by which a film is judged, this movie fails badly. Its characters are poorly-developed, the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity, and the acting, at best, is well over-the-top. Nevertheless, on the most basic, visceral level, the film succeeds.\nThose who went to LAST ACTION HERO and left disappointed because they expected a straight action film, will likely accord redemption to the summer of \&#39;93 because of HARD TARGET. Albeit with a thinner plot, this is the kind of no-holds-barred chase, fight, and shoot-out picture that has become a Schwarzenegger staple. Van Damme has an accent, the charisma, the physique, and the lack of acting skills. Really, unless you\&#39;re paying the check, it\&#39;s hard to tell the difference.\nAt the helm of HARD TARGET is John Woo, who is internationally-known for not pulling punches when it comes to violence (the two films he is best known for are THE KILLER and HARD BOILED). Indeed, he doesn\&#39;t merely direct this movie, he choreographs it, turning simple fight sequences into ballets of bloodshed. It\&#39;s compelling, albeit a little disconcerting, to see violence so lovingly and carefully photographed. HARD TARGET isn\&#39;t some hack job--a lot of effort went into crafting the picture. Snipped and put back together to avoid an NC-17, the film still offers a lot of mayhem and murder. It would have been interesting to see the cut that represented Woo\&#39;s initial vision.\nThere is perhaps a little too much slow-motion photography, and the score, while capturing the flavor of Louisiana, often becomes intrusive. Early in the film, it seems that every time we\&#39;re treated to a shot of Van Damme, he\&#39;s walking towards us in slow-motion with his overcoat flapping in the breeze while an unnecessary blast of music blares from the theater speakers.\nThe first half of the film occasionally slows up for some silly exposition, but by the mid-point, the hunt is underway, and it\&#39;s all action from there. If, by five minutes into the movie, you haven\&#39;t put your brain into park, this is going to seem like an utterly ridiculous effort. Those who are willing to get into the spirit are in for a roller-coaster ride directed by a master and acted by someone who knows how to kick higher than most people can jump.\nI\&#39;m not going to say much about the plot, because it\&#39;s far too contrived to be worth mentioning. Suffice it to say that if the success of HARD TARGET depended on it, the movie would be sunk. Even for the action-oriented film-goer, there are a few moments too hard to swallow (where\&#39;s the &#34;S&#34; on Van Damme\&#39;s chest?). If nothing else, they\&#39;re good for comic relief which, fortunately (or should I say &#34;hopefully&#34;) seems to be Woo\&#39;s intent.\nLance Henriksen enjoys himself immensely. He\&#39;s fun to watch, but he goes so far over-the-top that I\&#39;m not sure it would be justified to call what he does a &#34;performance&#34;. Regardless, he provides an excellent and much-needed counterpoint to Van Damme\&#39;s ho-hum delivery. The hero, after all, is good with his kicks and punches, but not his lines. Yancy Butler does a poor job, even considering the company she keeps. Someone who can make Van Damme look like a drama school graduate really needs to take some acting lessons (although, admittedly, there\&#39;s a scene with a snake where she\&#39;s fantastic). And couldn\&#39;t they have gotten someone a little more lively than Wilford Brimley for Chance\&#39;s lunatic uncle?\nAnyway, you pretty much get the idea. Without the elegant technique of John Woo, HARD TARGET could have been a real dud. It is not a good alternative to more intelligent thrillers such as IN THE LINE OF FIRE and THE FUGITIVE, but that\&#39;s not the market it\&#39;s aimed at. However, those that enter a darkened theater showing this film with a reasonable idea of what they\&#39;re getting themselves into, are likely to emerge satisfied.\n&#39;,

Intrigued by the idea of some quick, easy money, Nashe offers Pozzi a proposition. He\&#39;ll advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fifty-fifty. The deal is struck and the two are off to the rural Pennsylvania residence of Flower and Stone (Charles Durning and Joel Grey), where the games begin.\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE is a film of many levels. At its most literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which include building a ten-thousand stone wall. However, those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience. While final scene, dripping with meaning, gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot of questions left unanswered.\nPeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it. There you will find other questions, but these are of a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature. THE MUSIC OF CHANCE explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives. It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust.\nAt the center of the story are three characters. James Nashe is the basic &#34;nice guy&#34; who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost. He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves. On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with. Calvin Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny.\nMetaphors abound, from the &#34;wailing wall&#34; to the &#34;City of the World&#34; being built by Willie Stone. In fact, there\&#39;s so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning. There are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.\nCharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces, and necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF CHANCE. As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are completely understandable. Calvin Murks starts out as something of an enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip out.\nJames Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack. M. Emmet Walsh does his usual &#34;good ol\&#39; boy&#34; routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner. The standout, however, is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and battered by fate\&#39;s cruel whims.\nThe film\&#39;s conclusion is it\&#39;s greatest weakness. Aside from being relatively predictable, it isn\&#39;t entirely satisfactory. Movies such as this don\&#39;t have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together. Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and how it all ends up.\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption. After all, how many people out for an evening\&#39;s light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about poker and wall building? Nevertheless, as is often the case with movies such as this, there\&#39;s more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be seen with the first casual glance. An investment of time is needed and, for the most part, rewarded.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Johnny (Ernie Reyes, Jr.) thinks he\&#39;s just another Southern California &#34;dude&#34; who loves sand, surfing, and babes. He starts to re-evaluate the situation, however, when a bunch of ninjas try to kill him. Never fear, though, there\&#39;s someone around to explain to Johnny (and the audience) what\&#39;s going on. You see, Johnny and his younger brother are actually princes from a South Pacific island that has been taken over by the evil Colonel Chi (Leslie Nielsen). Until now, they\&#39;ve been hidden from Chi, but the dastardly dictator has found them at last, and now he wants them dead. So, in true heroic fashion, Johnny decides to go to the island and confront Chi so that his people can be released from oppression. Of course, along the way there\&#39;s plenty of time for surfing and unfunny jokes.\nSURF NINJAS could just as easily be called LESLIE NIELSEN\&#39;S QUEST FOR A FAST PAYCHECK. Actually, even though Nielsen is given prominent co-billing, if you blink, you might miss him. And even for those few moments when he is on screen, he\&#39;s obviously holding back his talent for a film with greater depth and profundity--like the third NAKED GUN movie. After all, who says you actually have to act to get the money? In SUPERMAN and CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, Marlon Brando proved that you can sleepwalk your way through a role and still get paid handsomely.\nSURF NINJAS takes the summer\&#39;s prize for most moronic movie. Considering the competition, which includes a sequel to WEEKEND AT BERNIE\&#39;S and yet another installment in the never-ending FRIDAY THE 13TH series, that\&#39;s quite a distinction.\nDan Gordon is listed in the credits as having written the film. If I were him, I would have sued to get my name removed. The lack of creativity and originality shown in this script might forever ruin his career. Then again, if this is the best he can come up with, maybe Hollywood is better off without him. There are enough second-rate hacks out there anyway.\nWhat can you say about a movie that bills itself as an &#34;action comedy,&#34; yet fails miserably on both counts. The one-liners, aside from attaining the expected level of juvenile predictability, aren\&#39;t funny, and the physical humor never rises above the standards of a Saturday morning cartoon. Oh, it\&#39;s a real riot when a guy goes tumbling and thudding down a 300-step flight of stone stairs only to climb back up and do it again. What inspired comedy!\nAs director, Neal Israel (who really should have taken on the Alan Smithee pseudonym for this project) has to take the blame for the poor quality of the action scenes. Even the worst shoot-\&#39;em-ups are generally competent in this regard, but SURF NINJAS has a problem. The stunt work is poorly-coordinated and it\&#39;s easy to predict where an explosion is going to occur before it actually goes off. Why, you ask yourself, are all those people running away from that apparently-barren patch of ground?\nSURF NINJAS gives family films a bad name. It\&#39;s curious how unpleasant every movie with &#34;ninja&#34; in the title has been. Then again, hearing that something is called SURF NINJAS doesn\&#39;t exactly conjure up images of solid entertainment. Unfortunately, this picture is far worse than one typically envisions, even considering the name and the stupid tag line of &#34;Surf\&#39;s Up! Time to save the world.&#34; Oh, well. At least seeing this movie wasn\&#39;t a complete waste. Now I have another worthy contender for a spot on the Worst 10 list of 1993.\n&#39;,
 &#39;In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to open an antique shop called &#34;Needful Things.&#34; Most of Castle Rock\&#39;s residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956 Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a necklace that can take away an arthritic\&#39;s pain. The price asked by Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal, so be it. The only one immune to &#34;Needful Things&#34; appears to be Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the carnage starts, it\&#39;s up to him to stop it.\nHow is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre? Perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is.\nWhat at the outset is the film\&#39;s strength turns into its greatest liability. The basic concept is solid: a gentle-seeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite people\&#39;s greed to turn them against one another. Unfortunately, once that has happened, the movie doesn\&#39;t know where to go with the story, so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.\nThe final scene isn\&#39;t the problem; it\&#39;s the one that immediately precedes it. This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen. The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Those that sit through this picture deserve more than they\&#39;re given.\nIt\&#39;s too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise. There are the usual horror staples, like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands. The terror here is more psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock. Leland Gaunt only causes it to surface.\nMax von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS. He manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance. He\&#39;s the bad guy, all right--there\&#39;s never any doubt about that--but he\&#39;s so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly, that it\&#39;s almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him. Certainly, it\&#39;s von Sydow\&#39;s rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.\nEd Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great ability in the past, but none of that is evident here. The best of the three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small. Plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature. Harris, who\&#39;s supposed to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.\nIf he hasn\&#39;t done so well with three of the four main actors, at least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton) can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy atmosphere. NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its most banal scenes. Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston\&#39;s fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.\nIn the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and this summer\&#39;s MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed significant versatility and range. Sadly, the same ability is not in evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film. There are a couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle\&#39;s work, instead relying on &#34;Ave Maria&#34; and Grieg\&#39;s &#34;In the Hall of the Mountain King&#34;.\nNEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry. This seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is involved. Since I\&#39;m not a fan of Mr. King and can\&#39;t claim to more than occasionally read his work, it\&#39;s difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books. Whatever the case, in Leland Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year\&#39;s most intriguing villains. This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn\&#39;t there. By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything. Sadly, the answer is yes, but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of Max von Sydow.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Roberto Benigni, Herbert Lom, Claudia Cardinale, Debrah Farentino, Jennifer Edwards Director: Blake Edwards Producer: Tony Adams Screenplay: Blake Edwards, Madeline Sunshine, Steve Sunshine Music: Henry Mancini Released by United Artists\nIn 1964\&#39;s A SHOT IN THE DARK, Peter Sellers\&#39; Inspector Clouseau met a young Maria Gambrelli (then played by Elke Sommers, now by Claudia Cardinale). Twenty-nine years later, it\&#39;s revealed that Maria and Jacques had a brief fling, the result of which was Jacques Gambrelli (Roberto Benigni) who, during the course of this film, comes to be known as Jacques Clouseau Jr. Gambrelli learns of his father\&#39;s identity while working on the case of the missing Princess Yasmin (Debrah Farentino), the beautiful daughter of an Asian king.\nNothing is sadder than seeing a once-beloved movie series keep churning out sequels long after its time is past. Thirty years ago, when classics like THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK came out, they were among the best comedies available. Three more Sellers\&#39; PANTHER movies subsequently were released (THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER, THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES BACK, and THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER), none as good as the first two, but all worthwhile diversions. Unfortunately, Sellers\&#39; death in 1980 failed to stem the tide of the films which, at that point, should have been ended. THE TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER and THE CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER were produced, neither of which was worth the price of admission.\nNow, ten years after CURSE, just when we thought we were free of the series, movie #8 comes out. Finally, Blake Edwards has acknowledged that the original Clouseau is dead, not missing (as was the premise in the two early-80s pictures), so to fill in the gap he gives us a previously unknown son, played by Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni.\nBenigni, star of the farce JOHNNY STECCHINO, is adept when it comes to physical humor, and his abilities are highlighted here in four or five scenes that include heavy doses of slapstick. However, while these produce some laughter, they are largely regurgitations of material from previous PINK PANTHER entries. Beyond copying Peter Sellers\&#39; style, Benigni has little to do, and less by which to distinguish himself.\nOld friends like Cato (Burt Kwouk) and Dr. Balls (Graham Stark) are back, even though the thinly-plotted script can come up for no logical reason for them to be there. Each appears only briefly, doing the same old shtick. Of course, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is on hand as well, but he doesn\&#39;t seem the same. I guess the years have taken away his edge. The anticipated apoplexy when he learns of Clouseau\&#39;s offspring, is mild.\nBlake Edwards, although long regarded as a comic genius, has recently turned out a string of barely-watchable films. Gone are the BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY\&#39;S and SOBs, replaced by such memorable titles as SKIN DEEP (with the infamous condom scene) and SWITCH. Far from bringing him back to the glory days, SON OF THE PINK PANTHER further entrenches Edwards in the pit of mediocrity into which he has descended. Once, we demanded superlative films from him; now, we\&#39;re just hoping for something somewhat entertaining.\nThe opening titles are as uninspired as those for any of the PINK PANTHERs. Although they give the big cat his first opportunity to mix with live actors, the interaction is stale and fails to stir a chuckle. It\&#39;s sad, because I always considered the Pink Panther to be one of the funnier cartoon characters, both on his own and introducing the Clouseau movies.\nNot only is the animated panther not up to snuff, but the opening theme is sub-par as well. Henry Mancini\&#39;s well-liked &#34;Pink Panther&#34; tune is horribly &#34;modernized&#34; by Bobby McFerrin (&#34;mangled&#34; might be a better word). At least the end credits retain the original music in its full orchestral splendor.\nThere\&#39;s very little about this movie that isn\&#39;t disappointing. One might make the foolish assumption that for a PINK PANTHER film to be produced out ten years after the last disastrous entry in the series, there had to be a creative reason--preferably something new and inventive. Instead, however, we are lumbered with this cobbled-together effort. If there\&#39;s a mercy, it\&#39;s that SON OF THE PINK PANTHER should finally put the Clouseau family to rest. Then again, that\&#39;s what I thought about THE CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Winston Chao, May Chin, Mitchell Lichtenstein, Sihung Lung, Ah-Leh Gua Director: Ang Lee Producers: Ang Lee, Ted Hope, and James Schamus Screenplay: Ang Lee, Neil Peng, and James Schamus Music: Mader Released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company In English and Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles\nWai-Tung (Winston Chao) has a problem. Living in New York with a well-paying job, a nice home, and a stable relationship (with Simon, played by Mitchell Lichtenstein), everything would appear to be going his way. But his parents, unaware of his sexual proclivities, are expecting a marriage and grandchildren, and Wai hasn\&#39;t been able to get up the courage to tell them that he\&#39;s gay. But an apparent solution to the dilemma presents itself when Wei Wei (May Chin), a tenant in a building owned by Wai, must find a way to get a green card or face deportation. As a result, a marriage of convenience is arranged between the pair, and everything seems to be working out well until Wai\&#39;s parents arrive from China to plan the wedding banquet.\nWhat at first seems like a simple romantic comedy is actually a deceptively perceptive look at cultural, sexual, and generational differences. And, despite THE WEDDING BANQUET\&#39;s often-light, occasionally-playful tone, a forceful dramatic structure underlies the film. Of course, this is what usually makes for the best kind of comedy - a movie that cares more about its story and characters than making people laugh.\nThere are a lot of tangled relationships in this film, but all of them, no matter how complicated or confusing, are handled expertly. Everyone\&#39;s motivations are clear, and for once there\&#39;s no villain, unless you choose to name circumstances as the antagonist. It\&#39;s refreshing when a movie comes along that allows you to enjoy spending two hours with the people on screen.\nWriter/director/producer Ang Lee, a Chinese-American film maker, displays a remarkable ability to present and balance issues without becoming preachy, and while also avoiding the dangerous trap of cliches and stereotypes. All the characters have their own unique identities, and their emotions come shining through.\nWhile there isn\&#39;t anything revolutionary in the story, and some of the &#34;twists&#34; are easy to predict, it\&#39;s never clear until the end how everything is going to be resolved. Given the nature of the central triangular relationship (Wai, Wei Wei, and Simon), I had visions of a horrible, Hollywood-type conclusion that would have destroyed all my respect for the film. Thankfully, that did not happen, which shows the intelligence, good taste, and sensitivity of everyone involved.\nAlthough it deals with potentially-weighty issues and some very powerful emotional impulses, THE WEDDING BANQUET never becomes bogged down by its own seriousness. Lee manages to keep the production buoyant by including scenes that are often riotously funny.\nThe actors are uniformly good. May Chin, a huge pop star in Taiwan, gives a complex rendering of Wei Wei, managing to bring across the churning emotions of the one person in this film who really has no one. Despite this being his screen debut, Winston Chao is as impressive as any veteran, and there are no readily apparent chinks in his performance. Mitchell Lichtenstein\&#39;s Simon could easily have slipped into obscurity, but the actor manages a strong enough presence to avoid such an ignominious fate. Stately and dignified, Sihung Lung and Ah-Leh Gua breathe life into Mr. and Mrs. Gao, Wai\&#39;s parents.\nIt\&#39;s understandable why THE WEDDING BANQUET won the Golden Bear award at the 1993 Berlin Film Festival, and the Best Film and Best Director citations at the 1993 Seattle International Film Festival. There is enough depth in this picture to fill up several movies, yet THE WEDDING BANQUET shortchanges none of its interwoven storylines. While I won\&#39;t go so far as to say that this is a magical motion picture, it certainly serves as excellent entertainment on more than one level.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Released: 9/3/93 Running Length: 1:42 Rated: R (Nudity, sexual situations, language, mature themes)\nStarring: Julian Sands, Sherilyn Fenn, Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith Director: Jennifer Chambers Lynch Producer: Carl Mazzocone and Philippe Carland Screenplay: Jennifer Chambers Lynch; story by Philippe Carland Music: Graeme Revell Released by Orion Classics\nDr. Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed by Helena (Sherilyn Fenn), a woman with whom he had a brief affair and is now hopelessly smitten. Helena, however, feels nothing but disdain for Nick, and shows it at every possible opportunity. Nevertheless, one day the good doctor manages to lure the object of his desires back to his home. The &#34;romantic lunch&#34; doesn\&#39;t turn out as planned, but when Helena storms away from his house and into the street out front, she\&#39;s struck by a truck and seriously injured. Not wanting to lose Helena to a hospital, Nick elects to operate in his home lab, amputating Helena\&#39;s legs, then keeping her captive during her convalescence. When she becomes too difficult to control, he takes things one step further and removes her arms, turning her into &#34;a possession.&#34;\nLike father, like daughter. Those who expected a nice, normal film from the offspring of actor/director David Lynch are in for a big shock. Jennifer Chambers Lynch has borrowed a lot of her father\&#39;s technique and style, and Mr. Lynch\&#39;s own response to the film is that he (not surprisingly) &#34;really liked it.&#34; BOXING HELENA is far from the beaten track, covering subjects guaranteed to scare away major Hollywood studios and big-name stars. An example is Kim Bassinger, who was signed to play the title role, then backed off when she discovered that the script demanded her to play a character without arms and legs. She lost the battle in court, and BOXING HELENA won not only by receiving a monetary settlement, but by having a much better actress in the part.\nSuspension of disbelief is crucial to BOXING HELENA\&#39;s success (and the most probable reason it fails for those who dislike it). So much of what happens during the course of the film is impossible to accept given the logical confines of the real world, so for those unable to slip into the mood of the movie and naively accept the often-absurd intentions of the film makers, BOXING HELENA will be a huge disappointment--a mix of gigantic contrivances and impossibilities of ludicrous proportions. Of course, if one assumes that Ms. Lynch is going for dark comedy, that changes the viewer\&#39;s entire perspective of the picture, shedding a new and warped light on some of what is supposed to be serious (my own contention is that most--but not all--of the humor is unintentional).\nOnce it gets beyond a hard-to-swallow setup and into the meat of its story, BOXING HELENA is surprisingly involving and intelligent--especially considering how fingernail sketches of the plot paint the movie. The script is certainly not concerned about the reality of circumstances and the actions of characters, focusing exclusively on the weird and unusual relationship the develops between Sand\&#39;s Nick and Fenn\&#39;s Helena, the inevitable captive/captor emotional bond. The movie discloses its terms early, and expects the audience to buy into them, making no apologies for what it is or intends to be.\nThere are powerful moments in BOXING HELENA, most resulting from the interaction between characters. Neither of the primary parts is three-dimensional, but a fair amount of character development occurs during the course of the movie. A scene where Nick presents the limbless Helena with a gun and offers to kill himself or her at her request is effective because it touches on the core emotions experienced by both parties. There are other such scenes, but intermingled with them are events better ignored--including a dumb subplot involving the search of a boyfriend (Bill Paxton) for the missing Helena, and an even dumber attempt to explain Nick\&#39;s bizarre actions through flashbacks to a neglectful, promiscuous mother.\nOne of the things that works against BOXING HELENA is the performance of its lead actor. While Julian Sands doesn\&#39;t precisely do a bad job, he rejects subtlety in favor of overstatement. While not an over-the-top performance (take a look at what Bill Paxton does for one of those), neither is it an example of studied, careful acting. Too often, Ms. Lynch\&#39;s direction mirrors the job done by Sands. There are a number of scenes that are handled in a rather heavy-handed way, with a little too much meaningless symbolism thrown in for good measure.\nFortunately, Sands\&#39; opposite, Sherilyn Fenn, is superlative, giving an entirely credible performance as she turns a one-dimensional part into a vibrant character. It must be difficult to portray a limbless puppet, but Ms. Fenn never falters, making us forever grateful that the lackluster Kim Bassinger backed out. Admittedly, Ms. Fenn looks a little too good for someone who had gone through Helena\&#39;s trauma, but that\&#39;s another area where suspension of disbelief comes into play.\nThe prosthetics of the amputations are never shown, and Ms. Fenn\&#39;s own limbs are hidden through simple trickery, so there\&#39;s no real need to comment on &#34;special effects&#34;. They are, in this case, no more or less than are necessary to tell the story. Although Helena\&#39;s armless, legless impotence might be somewhat macabre, it isn\&#39;t presented distastefully, resulting in a production that\&#39;s more erotic than misogynistic.\nA series of about five scenes comprises an ending which will probably polarize viewers into two different camps--those that approve of the choices made by Ms. Lynch, and those who feel cheated and betrayed by them. Personally, I accepted this part of the movie as reasonable, and certainly no more outlandish than what went before. A great deal is explained that would otherwise have remained mystifying. However, I disliked the final scene, especially the voiceover by Julian Sands. If Ms. Lynch wanted ambiguity, she should have left things as they were; if she wanted a clear resolution, she should have added a few more minutes of footage. As it is, her mix of the two methods is decidedly unsatisfactory.\nThe general opinion will probably be largely negative, but there are people who will love this film. BOXING HELENA has elements to recommend it, but there\&#39;s a lot that has to be willingly overlooked to get to that. Cynical viewers will not enjoy it, except as something to poke fun at. My own opinion is divided, although I will admit to having enjoyed the picture more than not, but any recommendation I make comes with heavy reservations.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Mark Dacascos, Paco Christian Prieto, Stacey Travis, Geoffrey Lewis, Todd Susman Director: Sheldon Lettich Producers: Samuel Hadida, Stuart S. Shapiro, and Steven G. Menkin Screenplay: Sheldon Lettich and Luis Esteban Music: Harvey W. Mason Released by Twentieth Century Fox\nLuis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs. Determined to do all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis): give him the twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies, he\&#39;ll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed for the better. Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn\&#39;t pleased about this at all.\nGoing into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action films. I was wrong. It\&#39;s a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message. I think I prefer this sorts of film when it doesn\&#39;t try to preach. Somehow, sermonizing and beating peoples\&#39; brains in don\&#39;t make an appealing combination.\nDon\&#39;t look for even a whiff of originality in this film. It takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends. Not that you\&#39;re likely to care, but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis\&#39; girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis)? Or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep Luis in line?\nThere are also a number of transitional scenes that aren\&#39;t there (although where they got left out, I don\&#39;t know--they could be on the cutting room floor). For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to Luis that they\&#39;re no longer kids and, while she admires what he\&#39;s trying to do, it\&#39;s over between them since she has a new boyfriend. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully intimate. Talk about a jarring turn of events....\nThen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably, get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher. Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the President\&#39;s attention. What\&#39;s even more astounding is that Luis never gets stabbed or shot. There are some token guns and knives in evidence, but nothing close to what you\&#39;d expect at the High School from Hell. Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message, not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys.\nSpeaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to make Silverio the meanest hombre you\&#39;ve ever laid eyes on. He\&#39;s nasty, sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat. He deals drugs and runs a chop shop. We never see him kill anyone, but it\&#39;s a given that murder is on his resume. Heck, for all we know, he eats orphans for breakfast. Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.\nActually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you\&#39;re looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt. I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at every possible opportunity). Mark Dacascos is also passable, especially when he doesn\&#39;t have to talk. Geoffrey Lewis, who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.\nMost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action goes so fast that it\&#39;s difficult to figure out who\&#39;s who. In the climactic &#34;match,&#34; the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn\&#39;t eliminate all the confusion.\nFor those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure &#34;cornball,&#34; you ain\&#39;t seen nothin\&#39; yet. Take a look at the final scene of ONLY THE STRONG and you\&#39;ll note that it\&#39;s got Pacino\&#39;s film beaten by a long stretch. Of course, there\&#39;s a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to.\nThere is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG. It isn\&#39;t boring--or at least not too boring. The message it tries to get across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful. If you want somebody to listen, you\&#39;d better put together something worth listening too, not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Date Re-released: 8/27/93 (Original release 1961) Running Length: 3:04 (3:12 including 8-minute intermission) Rated: NR (Violence)\nStarring: Charlton Heston, Sofia Loren, John Fraser, Genevieve Page, Herbert Lom Director: Anthony Mann Producer: Samuel Bronston Screenplay: Frederic M. Frank and Philip Yordan Music: Miklos Rozsa Re-released by Miramax Films and Martin Scorsese\n&#34;EL CID is one of the greatest epic films ever made. Anthony Mann\&#39;s sense of composition, his use of space, and his graceful camera movements bring to life an ancient tapestry where the transformation of an ordinary man into a legend become almost a mystical experience.&#34; Lavish praise from Martin Scorsese, one of the forces behind the restoration and re-release of EL CID. Pardon me if I am not wholly in agreement with him.\nThe story of EL CID centers around the life of Rodrigo Diaz (Charlton Heston), a Castilian knight in 1060 Spain fighting to keep his country from the brink of civil war so that it will retain the manpower and unity necessary to defend itself against the outside threat of the North African Moors. Diaz, called El Cid by his followers, becomes a living legend to the men of eleventh century Spain, and this film willingly expands upon every myth to surround the name of the legitimate historical figure. EL CID is definitely not a good source for a factual biography (the identity of Diaz\&#39; wife and the premise of the finale are a few of the more obvious occasions when the truth is completely ignored).\nUsing similar methods and equal care to that which was given to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the restoration of EL CID is an impressive undertaking. The sound quality on this new print is flawless and, for the most part, the picture is better than one would expect from a thirty-two year old film. There are several frames that are far from mint condition, but the overall effect is impressive, and the colors are never washed-out.\nThe battle scenes of EL CID are breathtaking, and well worth the effort of seeing on a large screen. Video viewing of the climactic struggle would greatly diminish the impact, and it is in this context that it\&#39;s possible to understand Scorsese\&#39;s quote. This is definitely a film meant for theaters. The television screen will serve only to limit the high points and magnify the numerous, often-glaring weaknesses. Instead of EL CID seeming like an epic, it could come off looking rather stupid.\nThat\&#39;s because beyond the spectacle and pageantry, EL CID\&#39;s virtues are limited. The costumes and set design are as impressive as the magnificent backdrops against which the turbulent struggles of the armies occur, and the effort necessary to orchestrate the realistic clash of thousands of swords is mind-boggling, but while these things add a great deal to the film, they cannot entirely cover up its shortcomings.\nActing is by far the biggest problem. While both Charlton Heston and Sofia Loren have imposing screen personalities, neither is capable of projecting real emotion or drawing us into a rapport with the characters. Simply put, Heston and Loren are wooden, and there are only a few occasions on which they manage to make Diaz or Chimene real. The chemistry between them is flat, conveying little, if any, passion. &#34;Smouldering&#34; is not a word anyone would use to describe this couple.\nThe plot is high melodrama with few surprises. Diaz is the hero, and he does all the superhuman things expected from a knight &#34;with God on [his] side.&#34; EL CID turns far more often to the ridiculous than the sublime, and the last scenes contain an element that is downright silly. Perhaps if the movie didn\&#39;t take itself so seriously, there wouldn\&#39;t be as many opportunities for unintentional laughter, but EL CID is about as self-important as a motion picture can be. It is an epic, after all, but in case we\&#39;ve forgotten, there\&#39;s always the needlessly florid dialogue and stentorian score to remind us.\nObviously, they don\&#39;t make movies like this any more, and that\&#39;s both good and bad. While there\&#39;s a lot in this film that modern pictures don\&#39;t need to harken back to, it would be nice to see some of the flair. When recalling great battles in recent films, only a few come to mind (LAST OF THE MOHICANS and GLORY, for example), none of which have the scope or sheer power of what Anthony Mann achieved in EL CID.\nSo, while I\&#39;m personally not ready to anoint EL CID as the timeless epic classic that it has become, I\&#39;ll not pepper it with arrows of disdain, either. This is a grand movie with tremendous aspirations that are not always realized. Nevertheless, it\&#39;s an entertaining, if not transcendental way to spend three-plus hours.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Starring: Patrick Swayze, Halle Berry, Sabrina Lloyd, Brian Bonsall, Michael Ironside Director: Darrell James Roodt Producers: Nicholas Pileggi, Anant Singh, and Gillian Gorfil Screenplay: Scott Spencer Music: Patrick O\&#39;Hearn Released by Hollywood Pictures\nJack Charles (Patrick Swayze) is a small time crook with a glib answer for every question and two kids in foster care. When his daughter Kelly (Sabrina Lloyd) escapes from juvenile hall and locates her father, Jack tries his hardest to get rid of her, but she persuades him to look for his son Eddie (Brian Bonsall), who is being placed in the same unpleasant place she escaped from, where children are handcuffed and abused. Recognizing the conditions Eddie could be subjected to, Jack kidnaps him from the authorities at gun point, then goes on the run with both kids in tow.\nUnless infused with some sort of unique energy, road pictures have become a worn-out genre, as proved by FATHER HOOD. It\&#39;s a mystery to me why films like this get made. Do we really need to spend ninety minutes following the misadventures of two children and an adult (who often displays less maturity than his offspring) as they run around the country trying to get to know one another? How many hundreds of movies and television shows have had the same plot?\nThere is little to relieve the tedium of this film, except an impressive performance by little-known actress Sabrina Lloyd. Unfortunately, this is not the movie anyone wants to have it said that they gave their most memorable performance in. Hopefully, someone will give her another shot in something where she\&#39;ll have an opportunity to catch someone\&#39;s attention.\nIf I had cared about the characters, perhaps the unbelievable number of plot implausibilities wouldn\&#39;t have bothered me as much, but no one in this film manages to grab more than a token amount of sympathy, especially not Jack, who is an annoying, arrogant jerk. Give Patrick Swayze credit (if you want to call it that) for playing this guy with the right amount of sleaze to get the audience to actively dislike him. Unfortunately, when he turns over a new leaf (as is inevitable), it\&#39;s tough to accept.\nThe two kids have their moments. Actually, I should say that Lloyd\&#39;s Kelly has her moments. Eddie, as played by Brian Bonsall, a young actor of limited appeal and talent, is pretty much a nonentity. The script tries too hard to manipulate the audience into sympathizing with them, and that immediately put me on guard. Movies of substance rarely resort to such blatant emotional trickery.\nSmall roles are given to notables like Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, but these two hardly have more than a few moments on screen. Halle Berry, who\&#39;s given second billing behind Swayze, doesn\&#39;t have a role that\&#39;s much more significant. It\&#39;s an understatement to say that her talent is wasted. I\&#39;d be curious to know why she agreed to do this film (the answer must have to do with the phrase &#34;big paycheck&#34;).\nOn top of all this, as if sitting through this movie isn\&#39;t a bad enough experience in the first place, the film makers manage to steal away any possible tension through their structuring of the story. We\&#39;re given the ending to start with then, knowing exactly how everything is going to turn out, we\&#39;re forced to sit through the details via an extended flashback.\nFATHER HOOD comes complete with a social message that\&#39;s as old as Dickens\&#39; OLIVER TWIST. Foster care in the United States has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as more and more cases of abuse are revealed. While I would support a movie that grapples with the problem sensitively and intelligently, this is not that film. It takes a good- guy, bad-guy approach to the situation and presents it from a decidedly singleminded viewpoint designed to stir the viewer\&#39;s emotions, not make him or her think about the seriousness of what\&#39;s going on. In fact, the low quality of FATHER HOOD may actually sabotage the message it\&#39;s trying to get across.\nRecently, an Italian film called IL LADRO DI BAMBINI (STOLEN CHILDREN) covered a lot of the same ground. That too was a road film featuring an older, somewhat callous guardian and the two children he was entrusted with. The similarities extend no further than plot structure and character background, because IL LADRO DI BAMBINI is an excellent movie, and viewing it makes the faults of FATHER HOOD seem that much more glaring.\nThere may not have been many like me, but I was actually impressed by Patrick Swayze\&#39;s performance in CITY OF JOY. I thought he had taken a big step towards turning around his popcorn-and-soda reputation. But with the release of this example of ugliness, I may have to admit to being mistaken. And &#34;mistake&#34; is a key word here, because that\&#39;s exactly what this entire production is.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Starring: Philippe Maron, Edouard Joubeaud, Laurent Monnier, Brigitte de Villepoix, Daniel Dublet Director: Agnes Varda Screenplay: Agnes Varda based on the memoirs of Jacques Demy Music: Joanna Bruzdowicz Released by Sony Pictures Classics In French with English subtitles\nJACQUOT is a tribute from one lover to another, a project that started out as a collaboration but became a both an homage and a means of saying farewell.\nFrench film maker Jacques Demy (who is best known for his surrealistic, often-offbeat musicals) died in October 1990, when production on JACQUOT was nearing an end. A filmed chronicle of Demy&#39;s childhood memoirs put together by Agnes Varda, his companion of more than thirty years, JACQUOT (the title refers to the young Jacques&#39; nickname) is a look at how the influences of childhood steer a man&#39;s creative spirit. During the course of the film, we meet Demy and his friends and family, see his love for the cinema, and observe his first attempts at creating.\nJACQUOT succeeds in engaging the intellect, but is less triumphant in touching the emotions. Despite the detail and care with which Demy&#39;s memories have been committed to film, there is a quality about them that distances the audience. We understand his desires, needs, and the everyday difficulties of his life, but little about this film is stirring. For all that the story is about Jacquot, there&#39;s a question of how much of the inner person we get to know. The film seems more concerned with presentation than identification.\nThe most intriguing and enjoyable parts of the movie are, by far, those that deal with the young Demy&#39;s early forays into movie-making. A fair amount of time is spent chronicling the development of a couple of animated shorts that Jacquot shows to his family in a home-made theater. In these scenes, we are given a peek at the creative genius of Demy, and it is through them that JACQUOT attains its goal.\nIt&#39;s always difficult to film someone else&#39;s memories without either missing the mark entirely or waxing nostalgic. JACQUOT falls into both traps at times, even as it occasionally hits the mark. Some of the most historically important incidents, such as the Nazi occupation of France and the subsequent bombing raids, fail to bring out the horror and fear that Demy must have felt. The truest moments are often those that seem almost thrown in as an afterthought.\nWriter/director Agnes Varda uses color to supplement the normal black-and-white in which JACQUOT is presented. Several scenes explode to life in a vivid display of hues, accenting a particular emotion or highlighting a scene. For the most part, it&#39;s an effective technique, although one that is possibly a little overused. Also in color are numerous clips from Demy&#39;s films. The inclusion of these works very well, showing how incidents from the man&#39;s real life impacted the movies he was to make.\nThe acting is solid from top to bottom, with the three young actors who play the growing Jacquot (Philippe Maron, Edouard Joubeaud, and Laurent Monnier) giving consistent performances that make for a smooth transition from one to the next. The occasional appearances of the real Jacques Demy on-screen lends JACQUOT a bittersweet quality that it might not otherwise have had. In some ways, the scenes with him, lovingly filmed by Ms. Varda, are the most moving of the picture.\nThe sense of period in JACQUOT is excellent, from the streets and countryside of World War II France to the garage and attic of the Demy house. As mentioned, detail is crucial to this movie and, at least in rolling back the years, such obvious care brings dividends.\nEven for those who, like me, have never seen anything by Demy, the depiction of the relationship between his memories and work is a source of fascination The clips from eleven films help immeasurably in this respect, yet even without them, there are enough moments in JACQUOT to warrant it a look from those who don&#39;t lose patience with this kind of simple, relaxed style.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Starring: Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny, Michelle Forbes Director: Dominic Sena Producers: Steve Golin, Aris McGarry, and Joni Sighvatasson Screenplay: Tim Metcalfe Released by Gramercy Films\nThere seem to be two ways in which films typically handle serial killer storylines. Either they create messy exploitation flicks with lots of blood and gore, little plot, and even less characterization (the FRIDAY THE 13TH series, for example); or they give a blunt, hard-hitting view of the subject (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, MAN BITES DOG). As with any generalization, there are exceptions, but probably no more than I can count on my fingers. Curiously enough, the latest mass murderer motion picture, called KALIFORNIA, falls somewhere in between the two extremes, and may end up leaving viewers from both camps somewhat dissatisfied.\nIn the name of research for a book he\&#39;s writing on serial killers, Brian Kessler (David Duchovny) decides to take his girlfriend Carrie (Michelle Forbes) on a cross-country car trip with stop-offs at famous murder locations. Hoping to find someone to split the costs with (his car gets only eight miles per gallon), Brian advertises on a local college bulletin board. Only one couple answers the ad: Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and Adele Corners (Juliette Lewis). They look flat broke, but Brian still invites them to get in the car, hoping that they can come up with the cash. During the first stages of the journey, Brian gets along with the newcomers, but Carrie is wary, and for good reason--Early is a murderer, and as the distance to California lessens, the body count piles up.\nIf you can get beyond the huge coincidence that sets up this motion picture, you\&#39;re in for a chilling ride. Sure, it\&#39;s a little hard to swallow that a guy writing a book about serial killers should happen to have one in his car, but this is one of only a few instances where an obvious plot device is used. There are other occasions when formulas come into play (such as the ending), but they are not greatly in evidence, and not every situation is resolved in the expected manner.\nKALIFORNIA is a partially-successful tale about conscience and cold-blooded murder. The film takes the time to develop (with varying degrees of success) all four characters, so that when the truth comes out, events gain a resonance they wouldn\&#39;t have with the lifeless stock personalities inhabiting the average thriller.\nThat\&#39;s not to say that all the characters are likeable, or even fully fleshed out. By the end of the movie, Early Grace is still something of an enigma, although certain elements of his brutal, psychopathic behavior have been made clear. Adele seems too naive to be real, and at times her childlike whining becomes annoying. Brian and Carrie are the easiest to identify with, probably because they\&#39;re the most &#34;normal&#34;.\nThis is no HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. The impact is far less wrenching, but some similarities run deeper than on the most superficial levels. Like HENRY, KALIFORNIA doesn\&#39;t glamorize its killings, opting more for the visceral than the grotesque. There\&#39;s also quite a bit of intellectual speculation about what motivates serial killers. While some of that is out-of-place, it keeps the audience constantly questioning why Early sometimes reacts as he does.\nOf the four principal actors, Brad Pitt gives the least impressive performance, probably because of the nature of his character. Early is all rage and self-righteousness. He\&#39;s never likeable, and Pitt doesn\&#39;t put a whole lot of effort into showing any humanity. There are times when Early comes perilously close to a caricature.\nJuliette Lewis is a little better, but great range isn\&#39;t required for Adele, either. She\&#39;s pretty much a simpleminded character who refuses to believe the awful truth about her boyfriend. She shows all the classic symptoms of a victim, some of which are displayed a little too obviously.\nDavid Duchovny and Michelle Forbes give the strongest performances, and since they\&#39;re the ones we\&#39;re supposed to identify with, the realism invested in Brian and Carrie lends added depth to KALIFORNIA. These two are fascinated by killers, but that fascination quickly turns to horror when they realize what they have with them in the back seat.\nKALIFORNIA is disturbing, and while it doesn\&#39;t overdo the blood, neither is the violence understated. The basic premise should be enough to keep the meek away--if you have no desire to see a film that follows a serial killer, stay away from KALIFORNIA. Those who don\&#39;t mind their movies sprinkled with moments of discomfort will find that this picture packs a little more punch than a traditional Hollywood slasher flick.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Starring: Christopher Lambert, Loryn Locklin, Kurtwood Smith, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez Director: Stuart Gordan Producers: John Davis and John Flock Screenplay: Steve Feinberg, Troy Neighbors, and Terry Curtis Fox Released by Dimension Films (a division of Miramax)\nIt&#39;s the year 2018 and the population explosion in the United States is out of control. The government has instituted laws that prohibit a woman from having more than one baby, but when the only son of John Brennick (Christopher Lambert) and his wife Karen (Loryn Locklin) dies as an infant, the couple tries for another child--and gets caught. Both of them are sent to the most feared prison in the country: The Fortress, a maximum security establishment from which escape is impossible. To ensure prisoner cooperativeness, each new entry is fitted with a globe in the intestines that, upon disobedience, can cause either pain or death, depending on the nature of the infraction. The Fortress is not a nice place, and its director (Kurtwood Smith) is an emotionless servant of machines.\nEvery time a movie about the near future presents such a bleak picture of life on Earth, I always hope for a reasonable explanation about how things got so bad. Personally, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask. However, for the most part, the film makers don&#39;t agree (apologies to pictures such as the TERMINATOR series), since they could care less about such details. They have a specific situation that needs to be set up to tell their story; everything else is irrelevant. FORTRESS falls right into that category. We can make a few guesses based on clues presented in the film, but even the best picture will be incomplete.\nThe pattern of this film is unusual. Most movies, no matter how good or bad, have peaks and valleys during the course of their running time. FORTRESS, on the other hand, while starting at a pretty high level, manages a consistent downward trend throughout. It&#39;s somewhat out-of-the-ordinary to be able to say that a movie gets uniformly worse with every passing scene. It&#39;s only the strength of the beginning that keeps this film from collapsing into the nether regions inhabited by such nightmares as SPLIT SECOND, another science fiction gorefest that takes place in a dreary near-future Earth.\nThe early minutes of FORTRESS are brimming with promise. Scenes bristle with the potential of interesting characters, strong interaction, and intelligent plot twists. Alas, little or nothing comes of most of these instances; they become a method of cruel teasing, tantalizing the viewer with what might have been. The film degenerates from intriguing to routine to dumb, all in the space of ninety minutes. By the end, it&#39;s all formula. The action has become commonplace and the characters flat.\nThe cast does a reasonable job. Christopher Lambert is probably a better actor than the role deserves, and he occasionally manages to make Jack Brennick believable. Similar praise goes to Loryn Locklin, an attractive blonde who infuses her character with strength of mind and heart. Lincoln Kilpatrick does as much as he can with a secondary part, creating one of the few minor characters that the audiences comes to care about.\nUltimately, FORTRESS is nonsense, even if the slick futuristic setting tries to put a new spin on the tried and true chase sequences. Once the slant of the script changes from exploring the internal mechanisms of the Fortress to following Brennick&#39;s escape plans, the movie is sunk. It&#39;s also at this point that significant plot implausibilities start cropping up.\nOne thing FORTRESS has going for is an impressive visual style--at least for those who can stand a lot of gore. There are exploding stomachs, dismembered bodies, and a great deal of blood--all done quite graphically, for the most part (would you expect anything different from the director of RE-ANIMATOR?). The set design is excellent, and the action scenes are well-paced, if lacking in legitimate surprises.\nFORTRESS isn&#39;t terrible science fiction, but it&#39;s far from the top. Hampered by a storyline that never reverses a downward trend, the movie is unable to get on course. Instead of entering the rarefied atmosphere inhabited by such films as ALIENS and the original TERMINATOR, it falls in line with the likes of FREEJACK and ALIEN 3. Not the best company to be in, but it could be worse. Watch SPLIT SECOND and you&#39;ll understand how bad things can get in this genre. After that experience, FORTRESS will look like high art.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Well, either CALENDAR GIRL is a blatant attempt to showcase Jason Priestley (of BEVERLY HILLS 90210 fame), or it\&#39;s an undertaking to make a big-screen copy of the popular 70s sitcom HAPPY DAYS. One might naturally assume the former until a look at the credits reveals the name of Penny Marshall as executive producer--the same Penny Marshall who played Laverne in the HAPPY DAYS spin-off.\nThe story is simple enough: in 1962, three guys just out of high school (Priestley as Roy, Gabriel Olds as Ned, and Jerry O\&#39;Connell as Scott) decide to drive to California to meet the girl of their dreams--Marilyn Monroe. Along the way, they encounter numerous routine sit-com situations, a lot of bad dialogue, and a few &#34;emotional&#34; moments that will make you want to retch. Eventually, of course, they come face-to-face with Marilyn and learn from her lips the importance of having friends.\nNot only does this movie seem like HAPPY DAYS, but it has an unfortunate case of WONDER YEARS-itis, with lengthy voiceovers during the first and last ten minutes. If there\&#39;s something good to be said about the middle portion of this film, at least we don\&#39;t have to listen to Gabriel Olds talking over all the &#34;action&#34;.\nBoy, is this a stupid movie. And I mean really stupid. Anyone who foolishly goes to see CALENDAR GIRL will sit in their seats and wonder whether they\&#39;re actually seeing what they think they\&#39;re seeing. For those who can\&#39;t believe how dumb movies can get, this film is ready to provide a punishing lesson.\nNot only do our erstwhile heroes manage to meet MM, but one of them gets a date--and subsequently a kiss--from her. Now, I\&#39;m as willing as the next person to allow a little creative license (or, for this film, a lot), as long as the result is entertaining. In this case, the on-screen idiocy only makes it that much more apparent how implausible the whole situation is. Then the movie further shoots itself in the foot by announcing that Marilyn receives 5000 fan letters each day. Why would these three jerks be singled out of all those others for Marilyn\&#39;s special attention?\nOf course, MM isn\&#39;t the dumb blonde she appears to be. In fact, she\&#39;s a veritable wellspring of sagely advice. Now, I don\&#39;t pretend to know what the actress was really like, but I\&#39;m pretty sure it\&#39;s nothing like the woman of this film, who obviously has all of life\&#39;s answers.\nFar too much of CALENDAR GIRL is devoted to insipid male bonding, none of which amounts to anything, and some of which nearly put me to sleep. The banter is empty, and the characters even emptier. There\&#39;s a scene in a nudist colony designed to elicit chuckles that garners grimaces instead. Ditto for the scene with the cow. And the nonsensical subplot with the hoodlums chasing after Roy. Where do writers come up with this stuff?\nBased on his performance in this movie, Jason Priestley couldn\&#39;t act to save his life. He delivers dialogue with all the passion of a dead leaf, and is clearly on hand just to give the ladies in the audience a hunk to ogle (is there such a thing as a male bimbo?). To that end, he obligingly doffs his shirt. Gabriel Olds, who bears a remarkable resemblance to a young Ron Howard (there\&#39;s that HAPPY DAYS connection again), and Jerry O\&#39;Connell won\&#39;t open any eyes, but at least they manage an occasionally convincing scene.\nThe best parts of this movie are a series of clips from MM classics like GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and SOME LIKE IT HOT. Their presence is not a reason to see this movie, but they make it apparent how awful the framing story is. Glimpses of these movies make everything around them seem that much more unredeemable. All-in-all CALENDAR GIRL fizzles when it should sizzle, and most potential viewers will find more satisfaction staring at their monthly planner.\n&#39;,
 &#34;For those who live in and around Philadelphia, Joey Coyle is a local legend--a dockworker who came to be known and loved by a city of blue-collar toilers who forever root for the underdog (witness their infatuation with several perennial sub-.500 sports teams). Overnight, Coyle went from a nobody to a folkhero by not doing the right thing, an action (or lack thereof) of which everyone seemed to approve. After all, what would you do if, driving down the road one day, you came upon two unattended sacks of money containing 1.2 million dollars?\nMONEY FOR NOTHING tells a Hollywood version of Coyle&#39;s story, judiciously editing his life to make him more appealing to the masses (there is no mention of drug use), and to make the five days following his discovery more entertaining. The film starts with Coyle (John Cusack) discovering the money, inadvertently dropped off the back of an armored car, and follows his life for the next few days as he hides some of the cash, throws some of it away, and tries to launder the rest. Of course, he&#39;s also trying to keep his good fortune a secret, because by not returning his find, he&#39;s guilty of a felony. Along for the ride in MONEY FOR NOTHING are Benicio Del Tauro as Joey&#39;s connection to the underworld, Maury Chaykin as the launderer, Michael Madsen as Laurenzi, the cop on the trail of the missing money, and Debi Mazar as Monica Russo, Joey&#39;s girlfriend.\nBasically, the problem with this film is that it lacks the substance to keep it going for one-hundred minutes. In fact, it&#39;s debatable whether there&#39;s enough meat in the story for something half that length. Instead of a wistful fantasy about what someone could do with this much money, we get a plodding drama that takes a few stabs at comedy, not many of which work (although there is a nice bit where Maury Chaykin comments that the reason Ben Franklin&#39;s is the only smiling face on U.S. currency is because he never became President).\nDistilled to its essence, the plot of MONEY FOR NOTHING can be described in two or three lines, so it&#39;s immediately suspicious that the film makers managed to milk a full-length feature out of the Joey Coyle story. The result is probably no better--or worse--than most prospective viewers would expect. Take away the profanity and the scene with Joey and Monica rolling around naked on a bedspread covered with $100 bills, and you get something that looks suspiciously like a made-for-TV movie.\nIf there&#39;s a reason to see MONEY FOR NOTHING, it&#39;s for the supercharged performance of John Cusack, who takes his role to the hilt without ever going over-the-top. Cusack starts out pretty low key, but as the burden of dealing with the money (coupled with a lack of sleep) gets to Joey, the actor brings to the fore a manic quality that makes the eventual outcome of the Coyle case believable. In the end, Joey was acquitted of his crimes on the grounds that he was temporarily insane.\nMichael Madsen is present with his characteristic unemotional demeanor. While this style has often been a plus (in RESERVOIR DOGS, for example), it doesn&#39;t work in MONEY FOR NOTHING, and Madsen&#39;s Laurenzi comes off as a non-entity. Debi Mazar, doing her best Marisa Tomei impression, isn&#39;t particularly memorable as Monica (a fictional character who functions as a compilation of several real-life people).\nThere is a tragic, unfilmed epilogue to the Coyle story that those outside of Philadelphia may be unaware of. One month ago, even as he claimed to be eagerly awaiting the release of this movie, Coyle committed suicide. Depression brought on by drug use and the breakup of a relationship were cited as the reasons. These sad, off-screen events make an unimpressive film seem even flatter.\nThere&#39;s nothing horrible about MONEY FOR NOTHING. It has a story to tell, and it accomplishes that aim, albeit in a workmanlike fashion. However, with everything being so straightforward and unremarkable, I can&#39;t say it&#39;s worth the time or money. And for those Philadelphians going to catch a glimpse of their city on film, they should be warned that even though there are a few shots of familiar places, the bulk of the movie, while supposedly taking place on the streets of the City of Brotherly Love, was actually filmed in Pittsburgh.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Starring: Suzy Amis, Bo Hopkins, Ian McKellen, David Chung Director: Maggie Greenwald Producers: Fred Berner and Brenda Goodman Screenplay: Maggie Greenwald Music: David Mansfield Released by Fine Line Features\nOnce, Hollywood framed our vision of the Old West as a place of gallantry and bravery, where the good guys and bad guys would shoot it out, and right would always triumph over wrong. Women, when they had parts in these films, had few lines, and rarely broke from the stereotypes of dancing girl or meek, dutiful frontier wife. Lately, however, the images given to us by the film industry have been changing. UNFORGIVEN showed that the line between good and evil is blurred, and Posse made sure that the role of the black cowboy isn\&#39;t forgotten. Now, THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO comes along to clear up a few more misconceptions.\nOnce Josephine Monaghan (Suzy Amis) lost her virginity and gave birth to a bastard, her future was ruined. With her past sins hanging over her like a hangman\&#39;s noose, she has no choice but to flee the constrained, pampered socialite\&#39;s world she knew in the East, and head West. There she discovers that the best life she can lead as a woman is that of a prostitute, so she makes the bold decision to grab at freedom and independence by masquerading as a man. Whiskers and muscles aren\&#39;t necessary. The mere appearance of a female as a male in a time when it\&#39;s &#34;illegal to dress improper to your sex&#34; is enough to convince just about everyone.\nTHE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO follows UNFORGIVEN in presenting a gritty, dirty view of America\&#39;s Nineteenth Century frontier. The scenery is still nice, but it\&#39;s hard to appreciate a beautiful vista when an innocent family is getting butchered in the middle of it. There aren\&#39;t many heroes here; shooting people turns out to be a lot more difficult than plunking tin cans.\nLoosely based on the true-life story of a woman about whom little is known, the story of LITTLE JO is a masterpiece of detail and intelligence. Maggie Greenwald has done her homework, piecing together an engrossing tale that movies quickly enough to keep the easily- distracted involved, but not so rapidly that it misses the nuances of the situation. Touches of humor are mixed nicely with drama as LITTLE JO explores the entire spectrum of human emotions. And just because Jo has chosen to live life as a man doesn\&#39;t mean that she can\&#39;t yearn for her lost femininity.\nThe focal point of this film is Jo. As played by Suzy Amis, the character is perhaps not perfectly developed, but the actress gets better as the movie unfolds. I was particularly unimpressed with her early scenes (when she\&#39;s openly female), but after the &#34;transformation,&#34; she settled into the role. Amis is not an especially emotive actress, and her Jo is reserved--perhaps occasionally too much so. The most effective scenes are those of quiet emotion, such as when Jo sheds a tear.\nPhysically, Ms. Amis is not so classically beautiful that she can\&#39;t be made up to look like a boy. It\&#39;s amazing how much a change of clothes and a haircut can do. Certainly, the transformation here is far more believable than in ORLANDO. I was never able to accept Tilda Swinton as a man; it\&#39;s less difficult with Amis. Then again, she\&#39;s only acting like a man, not actually trying to be one.\nThe standout actor in LITTLE JO is Bo Hopkins, who gives a boisterous performance as the cursing, gunslinging Frank Badger, a rough man with as good a heart as they come. Hopkins makes Frank come alive, and his relationship with Jo, which deserves far more screen time than it\&#39;s accorded, is one of the most real and interesting elements of the movie. Would that all the other character interaction was as good.\nThe last scene belongs in another movie, however. Throughout LITTLE JO, the humor is of the subtle variety, but as the film draws to a close, there is an overt attempt at outright comedy. It works as far as getting laughs, but the presence of this moment somehow cheapens the twilight of an otherwise mostly-effective motion picture. LITTLE JO doesn\&#39;t need complete closure, and certainly not in the manner by which it is attained.\nLITTLE JO is successful in capturing the atmosphere of the Old West. Camerawork and musical score deserve credit for this--especially the latter. From the first notes of the opening theme, it\&#39;s apparent that the choice of David Mansfield was perfect for composer. Rarely has a score so expertly matched the tempo of a film--it becomes a vital part of LITTLE JO without forcing itself upon the audience.\nIf you like films about the &#34;new Old West,&#34; THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO is not to be missed. Even for those who aren\&#39;t particularly fond of Westerns, this movie still has a lot to offer. Keeping the conventions of the genre to a minimum, it strikes out in bolder directions, reflecting personalities and lifestyles through the eyes of a woman whom everyone accepts as a man. LITTLE JO loses its focus on a number of occasions, but never for very long, and never in such a manner that seriously jeopardizes the viewer\&#39;s overall enjoyment of Maggie Greenwald\&#39;s film.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Starring: Jesse Bradford, Jeroen Krabbe, Lisa Eichhorn, Adrien Brody, Spalding Gray, Elizabeth McGovern, Karen Allen Director: Steven Soderbergh Producers: Albert Berger, Barbara Maltby, and Ron Yerxa Screenplay: Steven Soderbergh based on the memoirs of A. E. Hotchner Music: Cliff Martinez Released by Gramercy Pictures\nIn the midst of the Great Depression, in the city of St. Louis, the family of Aaron Kurlander (Jesse Bradford) is falling apart. His little brother has been shipped off to live with an uncle, his sick mother (Lisa Eichhorn) has been admitted to a sanitarium, and his father (Jeroen Krabbe) must go on the road to make money. So Aaron is left on his own in a fleabag hotel, with no money and few friends. Life becomes a struggle for the twelve year old--the hotel wants to evict him and his meager supply of food is running dangerously low--and it&#39;s only through his remarkable resourcefulness that he manages to survive.\nRarely has 1933 St. Louis been so real. Steven Soderbergh (best known for his debut feature SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE) has taken the time and effort necessary to bring the period to life with uncompromising accuracy. Many period pieces give only token acknowledgment to the era in which they take place, but KING OF THE HILL has the Great Depression woven inextricably throughout. Flawless detail is an undeniable asset.\n1993 has seen movie after movie featuring boys struggling to reach maturity while discovering an identity. AMERICAN HEART, THIS BOY&#39;S LIFE, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER are a few of the better ones, but none is as impressive as KING OF THE HILL, perhaps because none has quite as simple a tale to tell. The film is what it claims to be: a series of interrelated reminiscences about the life of an abandoned child in the midst of one of this nation&#39;s most difficult times.\nThere is much in KING OF THE HILL to enthrall. The characters--even those we don&#39;t see much of--are rich, and the situations are, for the most part, entirely believable (I had a little trouble with a scene involving a runaway car, but that was the only sequence that struck a false note). Soderbergh has carefully developed this movie to draw out the drama without resorting to tired plot devices. The fact is, Aaron&#39;s story, no matter how plain it might initially seem, is powerful in its simplicity.\nOf course, to do justice to the plot, an effective young actor was needed to play Aaron. Jesse Bradford&#39;s performance is natural and unforced and we never get the sense that he&#39;s doing more than reacting to circumstances. The film revolves around Aaron, and Bradford is up to the task, regardless of the complexity of the emotions he is expected to show. Take, for example, the touching, bittersweet relationship that develops between Aaron and a lonely, epileptic girl living down the hall. The resonance of scenes with these two is remarkable.\nWhile no one else has nearly as much screen time as Bradford, the young actor has established actors supporting him. Foremost are Jeroen Krabbe and Lisa Eichhorn as Aaron&#39;s father and mother, each of whom does a fine job with their material. Krabbe comes across as concerned for his children, but painfully distracted by financial difficulties. Eichhorn takes pains to bring sympathetic realism to a small role.\nAdrien Brody gives an energetic performance as Lester, Aaron&#39;s best friend and mentor. Noted monologist Spalding Gray plays an intelligent, frustrated middle-aged man whose relationship with a prostitute (Elizabeth McGovern) Aaron has difficulty categorizing. The two are obviously intimate, yet they appear to have only contempt for one another. McGovern, like Karen Allen as Aaron&#39;s teacher, is underused.\nIt&#39;s amazing how something so deceptively uncomplicated can be so effective. The narrative is relatively straightforward; Soderbergh doesn&#39;t employ any unusual chronologies. His style is frank, not quirky, and lends itself to a number of powerful images: a starving boy cutting out pictures of food and serving them on a plate, a homeless man waving hello, a puddle of blood-tainted water seeping from underneath a closed door.\nAs in life, there are a few unanswered questions at the end of KING OF THE HILL, but most of these deal with peripheral issues and in no way detract from the satisfaction imparted by the film. Done with less mastery, this could have been just another run-of-the-mill coming of age story. However, with Soderbergh at the helm (confirming the ability he showed in SEX, LIES &amp; VIDEOTAPE which some thought might have been a flash in the pan after the disappointing follow-up of KAFKA), this becomes a remarkable odyssey about a resilient young hero who uses both his imagination and his sense of reality to survive.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Starring: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot Director: Tony Scott Producers: Bill Unger, Steve Perry, and Samuel Hadida Screenplay: Quentin Tarantino Music: Hans Zimmer Released by Warner Brothers\nIt\&#39;s dangerous to live in Quentin Tarantino\&#39;s world, as Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) discovers in the explosive TRUE ROMANCE. When Clarence, a loner with a love of low-budget Kung Fu movies, meets Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), a callgirl, it\&#39;s love at first sight. After a heady night spent in each other\&#39;s arms and out on a billboard making true confessions, the two decide to get married. After that, at the advise of an Elvis (Val Kilmer) who inhabits his mind, Clarence decides to go to Alabama\&#39;s pimp (Gary Oldman) and tell him that she\&#39;s through working. What ensues is a vicious gunfight that leaves two people dead and Clarence with a suitcase of high-value cocaine that everybody--including mob boss Vincenzo Coccoti (Christopher Walken)--want to get their hands on.\nThere\&#39;s good news and bad news about TRUE ROMANCE. The good news is that it\&#39;s written by Quentin Tarantino, the man who made a stunning splash as the writer/director of last year\&#39;s RESERVOIR DOGS. The bad news is that it isn\&#39;t directed by him. At the helm instead is Tony Scott, the man who foisted TOP GUN and BEVERLY HILLS COP II on us.\nLike RESERVOIR DOGS, TRUE ROMANCE is filled with witty dialogue; sharp, macabre humor; and more bullets and blood than one would think likely for the running time. Tarantino\&#39;s script is loaded with energy and brimming with power. This film is a wild, wild ride whose slower moments are still punctuated by one-liners that only one other screenwriter (David Mamet) seems capable of penning.\nDirector Scott tries his hardest to turn this film into a typical Hollywood picture suitable for mass consumption. His style lacks punch--he goes for the safe, pretty shots that can be found in almost any action film. It makes one wonder how different this movie might have been had Tarantino helmed it--his methods, which borrow heavily from John Woo and Martin Scorcese, are stark and crisp, and probably would have complemented the script nicely.\nThe story, however, is too good to be seriously damaged by pedestrian direction. However deeply Scott was involved in the production of this film, his role clearly didn\&#39;t extend to messing with what Tarantino had written. Those who have seen RESERVOIR DOGS will recognize the similarities, which include a hilarious opening conversation (TRUE ROMANCE\&#39;s is about Elvis where RESERVOIR DOGS\&#39; is about Madonna\&#39;s &#34;Like a Virgin&#34;) and a multi-sided, drawn-guns showdown.\nMy favorite scene is a confrontation between mob don Christopher Walken and Clarence\&#39;s father (Dennis Hopper). Sparks, as well as any number of racial epithets, fly during this visceral and violent tete-a-tete, which includes some of Tarantino\&#39;s best dialogue and Scott\&#39;s most proficient direction. Walken has never been more sardonically menacing, and Hopper somehow manages to give an impression of restraint. In a word, this four-minute gem is astounding.\nFor the most part, the characters are well-written and nicely-developed. My lone quibble is that the romance between Clarence and Alabama seemed forced. Necessary though it is to the plot, it\&#39;s rushed through too quickly, and I had a hard time accepting how desperately in love these two are supposed to be. While their romantic chemistry is in doubt, they make great partners when it comes to crime, bloodshed, and being on the run.\nChristian Slater and Patricia Arquette (whose appearance is unbelievably different from that of her last part, in ETHAN FROME) are perfect for these roles, knowing exactly how to put the right amount of energy into Clarence and Alabama without turning them into caricatures. The supporting players are equally good, including Bronson Pinchot as a boot-licking actor who appears to have been included more for comic relief than anything else. Those looking for another link to RESERVOIR DOGS (however slim) will find Chris Penn in the cast.\nIn many ways, TRUE ROMANCE is an assault on the senses. It works best in a big theater with an impressive sound system. Hans Zimmer\&#39;s score is on overdrive, and the soundtrack blares rock-and-roll. Somehow, TRUE ROMANCE on video isn\&#39;t going to be nearly the same experience.\nThe cautionary warning given for RESERVOIR DOGS applies: those who are disturbed by extreme violence and profanity should stay away. There is no single scene in TRUE ROMANCE as gut-wrenching as the torture in RESERVOIR DOGS, but there are plenty of bullets and lots of blood. The film is graphic in everything it does, and those who prefer sedate motion pictures will not find this one a pleasant experience.\nTarantino is a hot prospect now, which is good for anyone who enjoys this kind of intense, intelligent, and unapologetically violent thriller. Films such as TRUE ROMANCE don\&#39;t come along very often--movies unafraid of slipping the bonds of convention in the name of giving the audience something new and exhilarating. For those who aren\&#39;t bothered by blood and bad language, this is a motion picture to add to 1993\&#39;s &#34;must see&#34; list.\n&#39;]</pre>
