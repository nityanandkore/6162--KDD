              "['Starring: Tom Guiry, Mike Vitar, Patrick Renna, Chauncey Leopardi, Karen Allen, James Earl Jones Director: David Mickey Evans Producers: Dale DeLatorre and William S. Gilmore Screenplay: David Mickey Evans and Robert Gunter Music: David Newman Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nEight boys, led by Benjamin Rodriquez (Mike Vitar), make up a sandlot baseball team in Southern California during the late fifties. When Scotty Small (Tom Guiry) moves into town, he doesn\\'t know how to catch or throw, despite the best efforts of his stepfather to teach him. That all changes, however, when Ben befriends him. Now, with their ninth man, the sandlot group is a full team. However, although their little field is a great place to play ball, it has its dark secret, for beyond the home run fence lurks The Beast, some kind of fearsome dog about which frightful stories abound.\\nKids and adults will enjoy THE SANDLOT, but for different reasons. Children will find in it an adventure with a sense of humor that they can both relate to and find in an escape from the real world. Writer/director David Mickey Evans hasn\\'t forgotten what it\\'s like to be a boy in the middle of summer with nothing to do but swim in pools, pal around, and play ball.\\nAdults, especially men, will find in the movie a sense of almost-poignant nostalgia. The story is told WONDER YEARS-style, with a modern day baseball announcer looking back on his childhood (the narrative is at times too reminiscent of Kevin Arnold\\'s ramblings). As is frequently the case when we look back on our past, things are tinted by a pleasant glow that leaves behind only the better parts of the memories. This is the feel that THE SANDLOT strives for, and mostly succeeds in attaining.\\nThe common theme bridging the age gap in the audience is baseball. This is a world where the game means everything. There is no arbitration, no salary disputes, no 8 million dollar contracts. In the world of THE SANDLOT, baseball is still America\\'s number one national pastime, and, in the closing scenes with James Earl Jones, it\\'s easy to get a sense of the greatness that underlies playing ball.\\nThose that have a distaste for baseball will probably find little to like in this movie. While it isn\\'t necessarily written just for fans of the game, enjoying baseball--as well as having some memories of playing on any level--will enhance the pleasure of watching THE SANDLOT. Sure, the movie gets silly at times, and the second half isn\\'t as engaging as the first, but since the entire story is a fond collage of memories made more grand by the passage of time, it\\'s easy to forgive such faults.\\nTo classify this picture as a \"male film\" is to do it a great disservice. THE SANDLOT is no more a movie for men and boys alone than FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is just for women. Even though all the main characters (except Scotty\\'s mom, played by Karen Allen) are boys doesn\\'t mean that women can\\'t appreciate what happens on screen. Memories of childhood are frequently gender-independent. Men might have the inside track of some elements of nostalgia touched on by THE SANDLOT, but they don\\'t have a monopoly. And humor, as well as the love of baseball, are universal.\\nThere will be those who will find this film a too-silly fantasy, but they have either missed or chosen not to feel the magic that THE SANDLOT weaves. With the exception of some mild profanity, there\\'s little in this movie capable of offending. THE SANDLOT is an excellent choice for a family night at the movies. The previews for it may look bland, but this is one occasion when clips are unable to do more than scratch the surface of the mood and story from which they have been extracted. Predictable as the movie is, the FIELD OF DREAMS quality is not the only thing to like about THE SANDLOT.\\n',\n",
              " 'Stevie (Robert Carlyle) is an ex-con from Scotland struggling to start anew. In an attempt to change his life, he takes on a construction job in North London where he meets an assortment of others who, in one way or another, are just like him. He has no place to live, and doesn\\'t make enough to rent a flat, so his co-workers happily appropriate a \"squat\" (an illegally occupied place to live) for him. Soon after, he meets Susan (Emer McCourt), an aspiring singer with a lot of heart but very little talent. RIFF-RAFF moves on from there, detailing a short period in the lives of Stevie, Susan, and the workers on the construction site.\\nWow. RIFF-RAFF is a strikingly powerful film that combines a biting sense of humor with an uncompromising, true-to-life look at the lot of England\\'s working class. While movies like this are often maudlin and sometimes depressingly difficult to watch, in this case, director Ken Loach (whose previous efforts include KES and HIDDEN AGENDA) has guided his production down a narrow trail that perfectly balances comedy and drama. It\\'s a daring move and the film succeeds because Loach pulls it off.\\nOften, watching RIFF-RAFF is like seeing a home video. The realism is astonishing, and the background on the production makes it apparent how much trouble was taken to make it so. Writer Bill Jesse (who died at the age of 48 and to whom the picture is dedicated) incorporated his own experience from years of construction work, and Loach casted only actors who had actually worked in construction. Says Loach, \"The realism stems from Bill\\'s writing and the people in the film. We tried to get everybody who had experience on building sites because they all had to work--they all had to know how to do the job.\" In addition, it\\'s apparent that everyone involved knew how to act, as well.\\nRIFF-RAFF contains one of the most unusual romances in recent memory. It\\'s an earthy relationship, bounded by uncertainty, poverty, and drugs. Nowhere is the Hollywood mentality of how to handle lovers in evidence. Like everything else in the movie, their interaction is handled with an eye and ear towards mimicking real life. Every line of dialogue between Stevie and Susan rings true.\\nSpeaking of dialogue, RIFF-RAFF is in English, but Fine Line Features has chosen to subtitle the movie (in English) for American consumption. Why? The heavy accents of the working class are more than occasionally difficult to understand. Personally, I found the subtitles mostly unnecessary, but they will be invaluable to those unfamiliar with the guttural English used in this picture.\\nBest of all, RIFF-RAFF is not a downer. In addition to an overall lighthearted tone, there is enough comedy to keep this movie upbeat. There is a social message, but it doesn\\'t bog down the film, perhaps because everything is told from the perspective of members of the lower class who view their lot pragmatically. No attempt is made to contrast the circumstances of the workers with those of the more-wealthy (a theme that has been done many times before), so missing is the seething sense of indignation and moral outrage that often accompanies films such as RIFF-RAFF. For example, when one worker loses his job, instead of making a display of upheaval and anguish, he simply shrugs his shoulders, says goodbye to his fellows, and walks off, never to be seen again.\\nIn RIFF-RAFF, Ken Loach has fashioned a world that takes a few moments for the viewer to become immersed in. But once that displacement has occurred, the movie takes on a vivid life that will not be easily dispersed by the rolling of the end credits and the intrusion of reality. This is not a film of sudden shocks and emotional turbulence, but it is forceful and exceptionally worthwhile nonetheless.\\n',\n",
              " \"Date Released: 4/23/93 Running Length: 1:42 Rated: PG-13 (Mature themes, sexual situations, language)\\nStarring: Alan Arkin, Matt Craven, Diane Lane, Bill Paxton, Elizabeth Perkins, Kevin Pollak, Sam Raimi, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Kimberly Williams Director: Mike Binder Producers: Jeff Silver and Robert Newmeyer Screenplay: Mike Binder Music: Miles Goodman Released by Touchstone Pictures\\nA group of eight friends gather together at the camp where they spent several halcyon summers two decades ago. The camp director, Uncle Lou (Alan Arkin) has invited them back for a final get-together as he prepares to close the camp. Of course, there are various interpersonal dramas that have to be resolved. The marriage between Matt (Vincent Spano) and Kelly (Julie Warner) is on the rocks, a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of Matt's old flame Jennifer (Elizabeth Perkins). Jack (Bill Paxton) is trying to come to terms with his past. A year after her husband's tragic death, Beth (Diane Lane) is still trying to recover. Jamie (Matt Craven) brings alone his fiancee Gwen (Kimberly Williams), who is ten years his junior.\\nThere are some pretty good laughs in this film. One hilarious sequence involves Sam Raimi (the director of such films as the EVIL DEAD series) attempting to transfer baggage from a canoe to a dock. In another scene, Bill Paxton relates the humorous events surrounding his first erection. Both of these instances, as well as a few others, had the entire audience in stitches.\\nUnfortunately, the good-but-uneven sense of comedy and some excellent performances cannot camouflage the shallowness of the plot, the ineptness of the direction, and the pitifully juvenile dialogue. This movie desperately needed someone competent to take control, and writer/director Mike Binder is clearly not that person. Someone in high school could have crafted better lines for the characters, and Binder is obsessed with close-ups. He too often uses them in the most inappropriate of places, diluting tension and weakening interaction between the actors.\\nThe story is simplistic and the character conflict weak. There isn't an original moment in the film. Coming-of-age stories have been done so often that for one to make an impression, it needs to find a new angle (PETER'S FRIENDS, Ken Branagh's recent film, although clearly superior to this production, fell into the same trap--little that's new). INDIAN SUMMER doesn't even attempt to strike out towards new ground. It finds a comfortable, cliche-filled groove and sits there.\\nThe ensemble cast does a marvelous job from top to bottom. Alan Arkin, the consummate professional, is wonderfully dry as director of the camp. Kevin Pollak puts his wit to good use, although his one-theme jokes become tiresome after a while. Sam Raimi, not known for his acting, gives a credible performance as the glassy-eyed, inept Stick.\\nThe actors are so good, in fact, that despite being given paper-thin characters and embarrassing lines, they almost pull it off. Now and then, I found INDIAN SUMMER drawing me in simply because these performers are nearly perfect. All of them have been in good projects in the past and doubtless we will be graced by additional fine performances in the future. If there's a reason to see INDIAN SUMMER, and it's a very slim one indeed, it's to see the cast.\\nINDIAN SUMMER is Mike Binder's semi-autobiographical tale about summers that he spent at camp. Obviously there's a lot of nostalgia involved for him, but he fails to get it across to the audience. Cheap cinematography tricks like graying out the film won't suddenly cause the audience to wax sentimental. Binder fails in both the directing and writing fronts and if he hadn't chosen such an exemplary cast, this could have been a real disaster. As it is, INDIAN SUMMER is just a singularly unremarkable and uninteresting movie.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Date Released: varies (limited distribution) Running Length: 1:47 Rated: NR (Nudity, sex, language, mature themes)\\nStarring: Trisha Todd, Karen Trumbo Director: Nicole Conn Producer: Pamela S. Curi Screenplay: Nicole Conn Music: Michael Allen Harrison Released by Demi-Monde Productions\\nClaire Jabrowski (Trisha Todd) is a California author who has reached recognition based on titles like LIFE CAN RUIN YOUR HAIR. To write her next book, she has decided to spend some time at an all-female Pacific Coast writers\\' retreat. She arrives there to meet her roommate, Dr. Noel Benedict (Karen Trumbo), the author of the infamous THE NAKED TRUTH and an avowed lesbian. Noel and Claire are as different from each other as two women can be, and that\\'s the cause of inevitable friction. Where Noel is neat, orderly, non-smoking, and averse to casual relationships, Claire is the exact opposite. Yet as the story progresses, the two find themselves inexplicably drawn to each other.\\nIn the past few years, a number of films portraying the gay community and culture in a positive light have come out (the most controversial of which has to be Gregg Araki\\'s THE LIVING END). Most of these, however, have explored male relationships. CLAIRE OF THE MOON is one of the few movies to cross over and present the issues from the female perspective.\\nThe film has its interesting points, but almost all are realized on an intellectual and not an emotional level. There\\'s a great deal of academic discussion on the differences between heterosexual and homosexual relationships, the nature of intimacy, and why there is so much difficulty communicating in modern society. While the viewer may not always agree with the conclusions of the characters, it\\'s impossible to deny that the reasoning is well thought-out and the topics are certainly worth investigation.\\nThere\\'s another interesting feature about CLAIRE OF THE MOON that may make some male viewers squirm a little. Men are not treated particularly well in this film, and writer/director Nicole Conn makes no apologies for this. They are portrayed as little more than sex objects--bodies to satiate Claire\\'s hunger. Turnabout, after all, is fair play. How many times have women fit this role in male-oriented movies?\\nCLAIRE OF THE MOON ultimately fails because it does a poor job of entertaining. While the film undoubtedly attempts to pique the intellect, it is, above all else, a love story and, as such, should rouse the emotions as well. For a number of reasons, it proves entirely unable to do so.\\nFirst and foremost is the amateurish quality of the screenplay. The basic story is old, formula-riddled, and predictable (the only difference being that the lovers are two women rather than a man and a women). On top of that, the dialogue is unbelievably stilted. People talk like they\\'re reading from an intellectual treatise. I know a lot of people with excellent vocabularies and they don\\'t talk anything like the characters in CLAIRE OF THE MOON.\\nThe acting isn\\'t going to win any awards either. At their best moments, the principles are merely adequate. Their characters lack depth, more often acting as mouthpieces for a philosophy than as the unique people they\\'re supposed to be. Worse still are the five or six supporting performers who consistently go annoyingly over-the-top. One character in particular (Caren Graham\\'s Tara O\\'Hara) is so awful--a walking cliche with a terrible Southern accent--that the film is painful to watch when she\\'s on-screen.\\nFinally, the Nicole Conn\\'s direction isn\\'t much better than her writing. She has a lot of mellow scenery shots with Claire in reflective poses that look like they belong on the cover of romance novels. Accompanied by a \"dreamy\" score, these moments are almost comically absurd. Then there are the two fantasy sequences, which look and sound like poorly-conceived music videos.\\nThere can\\'t be many copies of this film, because the one that I saw (on the second day of release) was not in good condition, an indication that the print has been shipped from city-to-city. Other copies across the country (however many there are) aren\\'t likely to be in better condition. This is a minor quibble, but it is noticeable, especially at the beginning.\\nWhile it\\'s possible to applaud the motives of CLAIRE OF THE MOON, as well as its message, the project is simply not a strong enough movie to recommend. This is a good example of a small, independent film that boasts neither high production values nor good acting. It is a single-issue picture that\\'s too flawed to be given the serious attention the subject warrants.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper, Lolita Davidovich, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya Director: James B. Harris Producers: Marc Frydman and Leonardo De La Fuente Screenplay: James B. Harris based on the novel MONEY MEN by Gerald Petievich Music: Cory Lerios and John D\\'Andrea Released by Warner Brothers\\nJimmy (Wesley Snipes) is a Federal Agent who doesn\\'t always play things by the book. When a bust goes bad and one of his colleagues is killed as a result, the department decides to ship him off to Newark, New Jersey. He has seven days to avenge the dead officer and find the men responsible for his death. The killer, a man named Ronnie (Viggo Mortensen) is actually the flunkey of Red (Dennis Hopper). Red has Ronnie believing that he\\'s a big-time crook while, in reality, he\\'s no more than a two-bit con artist. Together, the two start on a rarely-successful crime spree with Jimmy in hot pursuit.\\nBOILING POINT is basically an average police thriller (although, surprisingly, there are no high-speed car chases) with little that\\'s new or original to offer to its audience. It tries to be more intelligent than most movies of the genre, but what passes for a \"higher quality\" script is just a story that\\'s a little less exciting. One of BOILING POINT\\'s main problems is that there isn\\'t a great deal of action and the ending is never in doubt. The few clever plot twists (none of which are substantial) don\\'t make up for general lack of energy evident throughout most of the movie. I doubt action fans will enjoy this film much, and those looking for a dramatic picture will be put off by the stock characters and predictable situations.\\nThere are a few characters that seem completely irrelevant to the overall plot. Many of these are in supporting roles, but one main character, Lolita Davidovich\\'s Vikki, serves no purpose other than to provide a few moments of subtle irony and an opportunity to see other facets of the personalities of Jimmy and Red. Unfortunately, these \"character-building\" moments don\\'t work well. In fact, in a movie with so many scenes designed to show the human sides of both heros and villains, it\\'s surprising that no one attains any great depth.\\nUnlike many films that focus on con artists and their scams, BOILING POINT only presents a few run-of-the mill capers. We keep expecting Red to come up with something brilliant, but the \"card up his sleeve\" is one that we learn about early--that he\\'s leading Ronnie on while training him to be his assassin. For his part, Red detests killing. He doesn\\'t even like carrying a gun.\\nBOILING POINT is based on the novel MONEY MEN, which in turn is based on a true story. While this naturally limits the scope of the plot, the manner in which the story has been converted to the screen lacks style. It appears that an attempt was made to correct matters in the editing room (even a casual look reveals that the movie has been heavily edited), but there\\'s only so much that can be done in post-production.\\nSimply put, BOILING POINT is an unspectacular movie that will vanish as quickly from theaters as it will from the memories of those who see it. It\\'s as mediocre a movie as there ever has been, with very little to like or despise. It certainly isn\\'t the best work done by either Wesley Snipes or Dennis Hopper, but neither of them need hang their heads in shame because of it. At least they got a paycheck.\\n',\n",

Until the two of them fall in love, that is.\\nBeyond recognizing that it\\'s a romance, it\\'s difficult to identify exactly what BENNY & JOON is supposed to be since it is liberally sprinkled with elements of fantasy, drama, and comedy. However, no matter which of those three categories the production team was aiming for, they missed the mark. In this case, the reason why is clear.\\nWhile writer Barry Berman infused his script with some clever plot elements, a few of which go contrary to the expected norms, he lost sight of two of the three principal characters in the process. Time was obviously spent sketching outlines of Sam, Joon, and Benny, but when it came to putting flesh on the bones, only Benny is given his due. Apparently, the assumption that Joon and Sam were off-the-wall was enough for the writer and director. Nothing more was necessary - show them as unusual and the audience will accept them. For Benny, a \"regular\" human being, effort had to be put into giving him substance lest the viewers identify him as one-dimensional.\\nThe success or failure of a picture like BENNY & JOON relies heavily upon the audience\\'s acceptance of the various relationships. A lack of strong, believable characters undermines the entire story. I never developed a feel or empathy for the coupling of Sam and Joon and, by the end, I didn\\'t care whether they got together or not.\\nA little whimsy doesn\\'t make a story original, and it certainly doesn\\'t replace solid characterization. BENNY & JOON\\'s selling point is that it\\'s a \"romance on the brink of reality.\" However, the actual movie isn\\'t nearly as fantastic as the previews lead you to believe. Aside from some quirks in Sam and Joon\\'s personalities, and few unusual scenes, BENNY & JOON is pretty much on the straight and narrow.\\nThe actors, saddled by a marginal script and uninspired direction (the camera angles and lighting in this film are awful), do the best they can with the roles. In the case of Joon, Mary Stuart Masterson gives a sub-par performance, but this is more likely the result of what she had to work with than the effort she put into the part. Whatever the case, Joon turns out to be unimpressive and too often fades into the background. Johnny Depp\\'s Sam fares little better--with one highly visible exception. Depp\\'s performances in several scenes of Chaplinesque physical comedy are standouts. Aidan Quinn, playing the \"straight man\" does a credible job--so credible, in fact, that he upstages his co-stars, which was obviously not the intent of the story.\\nFor the most part, technical details in movies should be invisible to the audience. Often, when something stands out, that\\'s because it\\'s done poorly. Aside from the aforementioned problems with lighting and camerawork, the editing was ill-considered, resulting in an unevenly-paced, disjointed final product. Also, the soundtrack is banal (perhaps the only tune of interest is Joe Cocker covering the Steve Winwood/Blind Faith tune \"I Can\\'t Find My Way Home\").\\nIn general, I try to go into a film with as few preconceptions as I can manage, but I have to admit initially looking forward to BENNY & JOON. Needless to say, it came far below the quality level I had hoped for. This is yet another case of a movie preview being superior to the film it represents. BENNY & JOON is too dark to be a good comedy, too shallow to be a good drama, and too \"real\" to be a good fantasy. As a result, it\\'s certainly not a sterling example of American cinema.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Lou Diamond Phillips, Jennifer Tilly, Toshiro Mifune, Donald Sutherland Director: Jacques Dorfmann Producer: Claude Leger Story: David Milhaud and Jacques Dorfmann Music: Maurice Jaffey Released by Triumph Release Corporation\\nAgaguk (Lou Diamond Phillips) is a young Eskimo living as a member of the tribe of his father Croomak (Toshiro Mifune), the shaman. Agaguk is impulsive and when he declares that Igiyook (Jennifer Tilly), a woman Croomak has already chosen for his own, is to be his mate, his father exiles him from the tribe. On his way out, Agaguk attempts to retrieve a stolen polar bear pelt from a white fur trapper. A struggle ensues and the trapper is killed. Along with Igiyook, Agaguk flees Croomak\\'s tribe. It isn\\'t long before the police, in the person of Henderson (Donald Sutherland) come to investigate the murder, and eventually the clues point in the direction of the exiled son of the shaman.\\nI think perhaps the intention of SHADOW OF THE WOLF is to do for Eskimos what DANCES WITH WOLVES did for American Indians. If that\\'s the goal of the film, it isn\\'t achieved. In fact, regardless of the purpose of the movie, it\\'s a failure. The only thing worthwhile in SHADOW OF THE WOLF is its cinematography, and even that isn\\'t tremendously inventive or brilliant, merely effective.\\nThe story is the movie\\'s biggest weakness. It\\'s convoluted, riddled with silly mystical aspects that destroy any hope of realism, and ultimately pointless. Many things happen that lead nowhere. It\\'s as if the people behind the film had a beginning and an ending, but needed an hour of filler to pad out the middle. Better than half of this movie--including everything involving Henderson--could have been snipped without significant loss.\\nThe dialogue is absurd. Most of the characters talk in grunts, monosyllables, words, and occasionally short sentences. Actually, they generally bellow and shout more than talk. Lou Diamond Phillips probably goes for nearly forty-five minutes before he has more than a couple of lines to say. Jennifer Tilly never says much of substance, which is probably good, considering the audience\\'s tendency to laugh every time she said something in that high-pitched, squeaky voice of hers.\\nJust about everyone, except perhaps Donald Sutherland as a Canadian police officer, is miscast. Lou Diamond Phillips shows little charisma and less ability trying to portray the rebellious Agaguk. Toshiro Mifune, a fine Japanese actor, is wasted, as well as embarrassed, in his role. And it\\'s impossible to understand where the production team came up with Jennifer Tilly for the female lead. Not only is her acting ability severely limited, but she looks nothing like an Eskimo.\\nThe musical score is intrusive and melodramatic. At moments of high tension, it becomes strident, much like that of a soap opera. The overall sound quality is dubious. There are some scenes where dialogue dubbed in later isn\\'t perfectly synched with the moving lips of the person or persons speaking (or chanting) it.\\nThere are a few worthwhile moments in SHADOW OF THE WOLF, although not nearly enough to justify sitting through it. The igloo-building is fascinating, as is the whale-hunting expedition, and the trek to the \"Top of the World.\" Other than that, however, everything is either overdone, underdone, or done so poorly as to not be worth watching. SHADOW OF THE WOLF has lofty ambitions--to be a saga centered around Canadian Eskimos--none of which are achieved.\\n',\n",

Based on the book BRUCE LEE, THE MAN ONLY I KNEW by Linda Lee, this film tells the story of an icon. Since Bruce is regarded as a hero by this picture, how much we actually get to learn about him is uncertain. At any rate, the film follows his life quickly through childhood, then begins a more detailed account of events as Bruce heads for America. DRAGON ends shortly before the title character's death, leaving one of the most talked-about aspect of his existence unexplored. Perhaps it's better that way.\\nThere's no doubt that, even more than Danny DeVito's HOFFA, this picture was devised to show Bruce Lee in the most positive light possible. He is larger than life throughout the film, whether he is fighting human foes or the demon that stalks his nightmares. DRAGON captures the energy and exuberance of Bruce Lee, but it fails to give more than an incomplete picture of the man behind the personae. In that way, it is unlike HOFFA, CHAPLIN, or MALCOLM X, three other recent, high-profile screen biographies that attempt to present a more balanced portrait.\\nThe Kung Fu fights, well-choreographed and obviously overdone, are executed in the same unforgettable way that similar scenes were done in Lee's own movies. In addition to being a homage to the late actor, they're fun to watch, and add an element of action to what otherwise would have been straight melodrama.\\nDramatically, there isn't a whole lot of substance to DRAGON. It isn't going to make anyone cry with its power of human insight. There are some nice scenes--especially those early in the relationship of Bruce and Linda (Lauren Holly). Also present is a subtle-but-forceful point about racism in 1960s Hollywood (as Lee is refused the chance to play the lead character in the series KUNG FU, which he helped develop).\\nJason Scott Lee is a good choice to play Lee. The physical resemblance may not be perfect, but Jason matches Bruce for energy and screen presence. His acting is not superior--there are two scenes (one in the hospital after Bruce is seriously injured in a fight and another in Hong Kong when his wife tells him she's taking the children back to America) that are horribly overacted--but Jason has charisma and that covers for a great many faults.\\nAn eerie dimension has been added to this picture by the tragic March death of Brandon Lee, Bruce's only son. It shifts the focus of Bruce's climactic battle with the demon, in which he fights to save not himself, but his son. An unexpected level of poignancy has been added to this--and other--scenes by a cruel twist of fate that the producers could not have foreseen. The movie is dedicated to Brandon.\\nDRAGON is a fun experience, but far from a great film, and those expecting a probing examination of Bruce Lee's life are likely to be disappointed. Still, as a celebration of the first international Chinese-American movie star, the movie keeps the audience interested and entertained for its full running time, which is not an insignificant feat.\\n\",\n",

It tells what happened before the events of that novel, explaining in some detail the history behind the mad West Indian wife that Rochester (Nathaniel Parker) keeps locked away in the attic. When Rochester is first introduced, he is a fortune hunter, and Antoinette Cosway (Karina Lombard) is the object of his attention. She has a sizeable land holding in Jamaica that he wants to make his own, so he entices her into marrying him. For a while, the couple seems genuinely happy, but eventually an ugly secret from Antoinette's past--one that may also foretell her future doom--comes to light.\\nWIDE SARGASSO SEA, faithful to the novel from which its story is taken, is a beautifully photographed, wonderfully sensual, and poorly-paced motion picture. The first half-hour moves along nicely, but then the film bogs down and by the last fifteen minutes (which go by in blur), WIDE SARGASSO SEA has become virtually stagnant.\\nDirector John Duigan knows what he's doing when it comes to using a setting to convey feelings. WIDE SARGASSO SEA is a vibrant movie, one of images and passions. His sweltering 1840s Jamaica is perfectly rendered as the backdrop for the tumultuous relationship between Antoinette and Rochester. Duigan manages something difficult--getting an audience sitting in a cool movie theater to feel like they're in the tropics. Equal credit must go to cinematographer Geoff Burton, who displays talent for the visuals of this film.\\nEven with its uneven tone, WIDE SARGASSO SEA might have been a success had stronger performers been hired in the leading roles. While both Karina Lombard and Nathaniel Parker are pleasing to look at, neither is capable of delivering dialogue with any consistent degree of realism. With the characters not being realized with full power, the storyline becomes plodding, and the movie threatens to grind to a halt.\\nAs a romance, this movie is mildly successful. As a tragedy, it isn't nearly as good. The fatal wedge in the marriage (the likelihood that Antoinette will eventually become as insane as her mother) seems overplayed. One must remember that this is not a a contemporary society and insanity was thought of much differently, but the film has trouble presenting solid character motivation during its second half. The relationship between Antoinette and Rochester, which was developed with great skill, is torn down with far less concern for detail.\\nThere are a lot of sex scenes in this film, but nothing to earn it an NC-17. BASIC INSTINCT was as explicit, and perhaps THE LOVER even more so--with one caveat. There is a shot of full-frontal male nudity in WIDE SARGASSO SEA. That apparently is a no-no for a movie wanting an R. As a result, this film gets the dreaded NC-17.\\nWIDE SARGASSO SEA is has a strong beginning. By the time the pacing becomes a problem, the viewer is engrossed enough that he or she is unwilling to let go just because the story is moving slowly. It isn't that this is a bad movie, because it's not. Rather, it's a question of how powerful it could have been with lead performers who could bolster--rather than mute--the strength of the main characters, because the interest in Antoinette and Rochester is exclusively what pulls the audience through the flatter parts of the story.\\n\",\n",

When the father of young Jay (Brad Stoll) and Arty (Mike Damus) has to go on a prolonged business trip through the southern states (he fell heavily in debt paying his dying wife\\'s hospital bills and now he has to find a way to make enough money to keep the loan sharks from killing him), he leaves his sons with his mother (Irene Worth), who owns a candy store in Yonkers. Grandma is a cold, cruel person who believes that boys should not cry and metes out punishment with an iron fist, and both of her grandsons quickly learn to fear and hate her. Also living in the house is Bella (Mercedes Ruehl), the boys\\' childlike, wacky aunt who wants nothing more than to have someone to hold and love. Stopping in for a few days is Bella\\'s gangster brother, Louie (Richard Dreyfus), a small-time operator who teaches his nephews a few lessons about life.\\nAs is often true of stories penned by play-and-screenwriter Neil Simon, this is a simple tale about simple people. No momentous or earth-shattering events take place, and there\\'s nothing that one would normally believe worth making a movie about. In fact, for about the first third of the film, it looks like the decision to finance this project was a mistake. Except for a few humorous vignettes, this part of LOST IN YONKERS is dull and unspectacular.\\nRichard Dreyfus has top billing, but he\\'s not in much of the movie. Nevertheless, despite limited screen time, Dreyfus\\' Louie is a pivotal character, giving impetus to the story. LOST IN YONKERS is almost half over by the time Louie makes his first appearance and he\\'s gone before the final quarter. Yet the character, fleshed out by a powerful performance, is the center-point of the picture, a marvelous mix of anger, greed, and likableness.\\nMercedes Ruehl\\'s performance, like the development of her character, goes through a transition as the film progresses. Near the beginning of LOST IN YONKERS, Bella is completely unconvincing, presenting a wide-eyed facade of sheer idiocy that few viewers are likely to accept. It doesn\\'t help that Ms. Ruehl goes over-the-top during these scenes. However, as the film moves forward, not only does Bella become more believable, but the actress finds her rhythm. It can be argued that the transition of the character is difficult to swallow, and while that may be true, I find the problem more to be where Bella starts, not where she ends up.\\nAlthough Simon has set this story in the 40s, LOST IN YONKERS is a rare example of a period piece that doesn\\'t strive for nostalgia. The costumes and settings are right, but the script isn\\'t laden with the too-common sense of longing that makes the audience look back fondly on days gone by.\\nThe pacing of LOST IN YONKERS is off. The first half of the movie is relatively light, with frequent bursts of humor. Later, however, the movie becomes an emotional experience, with almost too many intense scenes. The two children, who are clearly at the forefront during the movie\\'s first hour, get lost for a while as the conflict between Bella and her mother is highlighted.\\nThe story of LOST IN YONKERS is mostly solid and doesn\\'t suffer from the \"everything must be happy\" Hollywood-type ending, but the uneven tone hurts the screen adaptation of Simon\\'s Pulitzer-Prize-winning play. Something has definitely been lost in the translation, and as hard as the movie works to keep its audience\\'s attention, it\\'s only partially successful. Dreyfus is magnetic, but this is really Mercedes Ruehl\\'s movie, and she\\'s only occasionally up to the job.\\n',\n",

Holfong, and Wolfgang Glattis Screenplay: Michael Lessac Music: James Horner Released by Penta Pictures\\nWhile in Mexico, Ruth (Kathleen Turner) and her family suffer a devastating loss when her husband Alex is killed in an accident. Some time later, after being away for years, they return to their North Carolina home with the hope of starting anew. Shortly after coming back and for no apparent reason, Ruth's six-year old daughter Sally (Asha Menina) withdraws from reality. Although fluent in three languages, Sally refuses to speak in any of them, nor will she acknowledge the presence of her mother. However, she develops an affinity for high places and after she nearly kills herself climbing in a building construction site, the court places her in the custody of Dr. Jacob Beerlander (Tommy Lee Jones), a psychiatrist who's an expert in dealing with dissociated children.\\nI have the feeling that people will either love or hate this movie. Its success depends entirely upon the emotional reaction of the audience. It delivers a powerful punch, but the logic of the plot is uncertain and there are a lot (too many for my taste) of things left unexplained. Writer/director Michael Lessac has taken a few liberties with reality, occasionally stretching things beyond the bounds of credibility.\\nI'll admit to being touched by HOUSE OF CARDS, but even as the movie worked its skillful manipulation on my emotions, it confounded my intelligence with a storyline that doesn't seem well thought out. It's difficult to talk about specifics without giving things away, but suffice it to say that every time the movie got me completely immersed in its peculiar brand of magic, the script did something inconceivable that left me feeling unsatisfied.\\nThe acting in HOUSE OF CARDS ranges from passable to excellent. Kathleen Turner is good as the widowed Ruth. The character is occasionally difficult to watch, but that's more because of the emotions churning within Ruth than because of a flaw in Ms. Turner's performance. Tommy Lee Jones is perhaps too restrained as Jacob Beerlander, and certainly never sympathetic. Asha Menina, on the other hand, gives a memorable performance, clearly outacting all the adults.\\nOne of the most interesting--and believable--scenes in this film occurs in Dr. Beerlander's school for children as kids with various problems are introduced to Ruth. Unlike much of the rest of the film, this part is not manipulative, but is nevertheless moving, principally because it seems so real.\\nThe greatest fault with HOUSE OF CARDS is that too little of it is believable. In attempting to play on the audience's emotions as well as create an almost-mystical atmosphere, this movie has allowed too many difficult-to-accept contrivances seep into the plot. Given the potential power of the script, this annoyed me, in addition to presenting an unwanted distraction. I wish I could give a wholehearted recommendation, but the best I can do is give one with qualifications. Undoubtedly, there is an audience for this film, but I think it's a small one.\\nI'll reiterate what I said at the beginning of this review. Most viewers will probably either love the film or hate it. Those that can completely suspend their disbelief and allow the emotional tide of HOUSE OF CARDS to carry them away (as it did in Houston, where this movie won top honors at that city's film festival), will love this picture. Everyone else will find it slow-moving and hard to accept. Oddly enough, I find myself somewhere in the middle, having found some enjoyment in HOUSE OF CARDS, but wishing for a lot more.\\n\",\n",

Soon, however, it becomes apparent that someone on the force is in league with the criminals, and that the lives of both McCain and his girlfriend Anna (Charlotte Lewis) are in danger.\\nA detailed review of EXCESSIVE FORCE seems unnecessary. This film is made for a specific audience. Those who like these kinds of movies--festivals of mindless violence--will see Thomas Ian Griffith\\'s film, while those who aren\\'t fond of the genre will stay away. Little that I say here is likely to make any difference to anyone, but since I sat through this ninety- minute travesty, I intend to express my opinion.\\nAs is usually the case with low-budget action films, the plot is virtually nonexistent--a nonsensical affectation upon which the scenes of kick-boxing and shooting can be hung. For EXCESSIVE FORCE, no attempt is made to simulate reality in the story. There is no possible way that any genuine police department could be run with this degree of ineptitude and corruption.\\nThere\\'s plenty of action and blood, but not much excitement. Good films of this genre are rousing. This one is simply dull. Never do we believe that the hero is in any danger. This creates a sense of inevitability, draining most of the fight sequences of vital energy.\\nThomas Ian Griffith, despite bulging biceps and an impressive physique, has little to boast about. His acting isn\\'t any better than Steven Seagal\\'s and he lacks anything resembling charisma. Frankly, I didn\\'t care what happened to his character, as long as it happened quickly so I could get out of the theater. Someone is trying to make Griffith into the next martial arts star, but I don\\'t buy it.\\nJames Earl Jones makes a few appearances as Jake, the owner of the bar above which McCain lives. This role is superfluous and obviously included in an attempt to give EXCESSIVE FORCE credibility through the use of a \"big name\". It doesn\\'t work. Fortunately, Jones\\' reputation is solid enough that this shouldn\\'t blemish it. I hope he got paid well.\\nIn the past, I have been known (upon occasion) to enjoy mindless action films. EXCESSIVE FORCE doesn\\'t fall into that group. Simply put, this is a bad movie and should be treated as such by anyone considering viewing it, whether they enjoy the genre or not. It\\'s a decidedly unpleasant experience.\\n',\n",

From Cuba of 1896 to the U.S., Lee's posse moves west as he pursues vengeance against the men who murdered his father. With Colonel Graham hot on his heels, Lee arrives in Freemanville (a community of ex-slaves), the culmination of his father's dreams and a place in danger from a group of corrupt whites from the next town over.\\nIn constructing POSSE, Van Peebles has put together something of a traditional western with a twist: with the exception of Baldwin's Little J, the members of the group are black. Some interesting race-related points are raised, but Van Peebles disappoints by focusing instead on the standard elements of the picture. By the film's end, this has degenerated into little more than a 19th-Century shoot-em-up. POSSE is a violent movie, but without the grittiness that characterized Clint Eastwood's Academy Award winning UNFORGIVEN.\\nTechnically, this film is a mess. Considering how well NEW JACK CITY (Van Peebles' previous effort) fared in this arena, that's something of a surprise. However, in POSSE, the editing is sub-par--scenes often come to jarring conclusions. The music at times seems better-suited to a contemporary action film than a western, and the quick changing of camera angles occasionally makes POSSE feel like something created for MTV.\\nDespite numerous problems, POSSE remains an entertaining film. In addition to bringing a refreshingly new perspective to the western, it tells a solid story. The subplot involving Graham perhaps creates some unnecessary baggage, but the main conflict between Van Peebles and Richard Jordan in Freemanville is well-developed. We are also given a rare (for movies) glimpse into the interrelationship between Native Americans and African Americans.\\nA comparison to GLORY is worth making. In many ways, the intentions of the two films are similar--both attempt to redress the historical inaccuracies of Hollywood. However, where GLORY succeeds brilliantly by wedding the dramatic impact of the black man's role in the Civil War with its overall tale, POSSE fails to attain the same level. With only a few minor script alterations and some re-casting, this could easily have been an all-white film. Many of the most important and intriguing questions about the real roles of blacks in the Old West are sadly left unexplored. POSSE serves merely to whet our appetites.\\nEven considering the limited success of the attempt, it's important that the effort was made, if for no other reason than that to open a few eyes and make some people aware of the bias of a white-written American history. POSSE also has enough entertainment value to make it worth a look, especially for those who enjoy westerns. It certainly isn't a definitive film, but it has its high points.\\n\",\n",

There she meets a trio of unusual neighbors. There's Vida (Polly Walker), the girl across the hall, who likes cocaine and knows a few too many secrets. Jack Landsford (Tom Berenger) is a successful author who uses every ounce of his charm to snare a date with Carly. Zeke Hawkins (William Baldwin) seems normal at first, but it doesn't take Carly long to figure out that he's hiding something. Despite the oddities of some of the building's other tenants, Carly comfortably settles into her new home while someone watches her on a bank of video screens that show every room in every apartment of the Sliver building.\\nAs many studies indicate, voyeurism is one of America's secret pastimes. It doesn't have to be peeping through a bedroom window or watching a couple making love through a telescope. The seductive power of voyeurism is the knowledge that you're watching something real--not acted or scripted--and the players in the drama have no idea they're under scrutiny. It's addictive, and those hooked on it can become more involved in living the lives of others than their own.\\nIra Levin's novel SLIVER explores the dangerous obsession that can come about as a result of continuous voyeurism. While the book is not a psychological or artistic milestone, it makes for compulsive page-turning. The story is entertaining and focused (until the end), and the characters seem real. In the decisions made to turn the novel into a movie, all of that was lost.\\nIn the movie, voyeurism is a plot device in a script that goes nowhere and whose effete and implausible resolution leaves 50% of the audience's questions unanswered. If we really cared about the movie or its poorly developed characters, this might be a blow, but SLIVER is so badly put together that its abrupt conclusion is likely to provoke little response.\\nPersonally, I don't have a problem with a movie changing the story of the book from which it has been adapted, as long as the changes are sensible and effective. SLIVER, which rips apart the foundation of Ira Levin's novel (going so far as to change the identity of the killer), is a butcher's job--a hodgepodge of stuff from the book and Joe Eszterhas' pen. The strengths of the original story are muted and the weaknesses magnified. The ending is nowhere to be found, and what appears in the movie is so disjointed and contradictory that it leaves the viewer feeling cold and cheated.\\nBecause of writer Eszterhas and actress Stone, comparisons with BASIC INSTINCT are unavoidable. Actually, any similarities are superficial. There's a lot of nudity (but no icepicks) and a few deaths but, aside from Eszterhas' often-embarrassing dialogue, the two films aren't that close.\\nAs if it isn't bad enough that the script needs a major re-write, this lackluster production suffers from other problems. None of the three major players are in top form. Sharon Stone, who was effective as the femme fatale of BASIC INSTINCT, shows a lack of aptitude in playing the woman-in-distress. Her emotional range in SLIVER is limited and she fails to generate much sympathy. William Baldwin's portrayal is too bland for a character with the depth of passion and emotion that Zeke is supposed to have. Tom Berenger puts a great deal of energy into what is essentially a thankless role (his character isn't in the book), but little that we see or learn about Jack Landsford makes much sense. The gem in the rough of SLIVER is Polly Walker (the spoiled heiress of ENCHANTED APRIL, who Phillip Noyce also directed in PATRIOT GAMES), although she's on-screen for too few scenes.\\nProduction-wise, SLIVER has the look and feel of something from MTV. The incidental music is intrusive and the quick-cuts are distracting. With the movie's focus on video, it's odd that the visuals are so pedestrian. There is also a sense of heavy editing. At least one scene referred to explicitly has been cut out.\\nWith thrillers, it's difficult to say who will like what. Certainly, those who are looking for a good whodunnit won't find it in SLIVER. Equally displeased with this film will be the moviegoer looking for a fast-paced film. Even those who loved BASIC INSTINCT may be disappointed--SLIVER has little of the tension and relentless energy that marked Verhoeven's 1992 movie. All-in-all, there's little here to please anyone, and those who loved Levin's book are bound to leave the theater disgusted.\\n\",\n",

Centered around two romances--Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), and Benedick (Kenneth Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson)--the story follows these very different courtships. For Hero and Claudio, it's love at first sight and, as with any immediate attraction, they have a lot to learn about each other. Beatrice and Benedick, on the other hand, have known each other for quite some time and it takes a little none-too-subtle prodding from their friends to help them realize and admit their feelings.\\nWith HENRY V, Kenneth Branagh made a stunning motion picture directorial debut, setting the cinematic world on its collective ear with a rendering of the story that many considered the equal of, if not superior to, the legendary Laurence Olivier production. Now, two films (DEAD AGAIN and PETER'S FRIENDS) and four years later, Branagh has again taken Shakespeare to his pinnacle. If anything, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is better than HENRY V. If Branagh's place as one of today's standout directors has not been assured before now, this will surely clinch the position for him.\\nFor those who don't find Shakespeare's comedies funny (and it can be something of a stretch to laugh when reading the lines in a book), this is the film to see. Simply put, the movie is hilarious. It isn't just the lines that create laughter, but the way Branagh has set them up and the manner in which the actors deliver them. Expressions and actions often play a large part in the comedy, some of which is decidedly physical. These are the kinds of things that don't appear on the written page.\\nThere's also a fair amount of drama in the film as well, and the performers and director do as well with the serious stuff as they do with the lighter material. Pathos and poignancy come as easily and naturally as humor. Emotions run high in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and cover the spectrum from one end to the other. Fortunately, everyone involved is capable of upholding the pacing and tone that the film demands to be successful.\\nThe life and vitality of this production are amazing. Things move along with a breezy energy that makes it impossible not to get caught up in the experience. I defy anyone, no matter how boring they find the written Shakespeare, to fall asleep during this celebration. Even if everything else was low-key (which it definitely isn't), Patrick Doyle's rousing score alone would be enough to keep many people's attention. MUCH ADO is one of the most engaging films I've seen in years. That I never once glanced at my watch is testimony enough of how enraptured I was.\\nWhile Branagh is not entirely faithful to the original text of MUCH ADO, his film takes pains to capture the play's spirit. Certain (mostly small) elements of the source material have been excised, most of which contain obscure references and jokes that a twentieth-century audience would fail to either understand or find amusing. Only Shakespearean purists are likely to recognize the changes, however, none of which are gross enough to cause outrage to the few who notice their absence. The majority of the audience will never know what's missing, nor will they care.\\nAt first glance, some of the casting choices seem odd, to say the least. Regardless of how out-of-place certain names look, however, even the least effective of the performers does a fine job. No one who appeared in MUCH ADO has anything to be ashamed of about the effort they put into the film, or the result that appears on the screen.\\nAs might be expected, Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson turn out sparkling, flawless performances. Neither of them has done better work. Considering some of their past roles, that's high praise. When they are together, the chemistry is apparent. It was one of the high points of DEAD AGAIN and PETER'S FRIENDS, and that's true again here. Branagh and Thompson are worthy contemporary rivals of any of the silver screen's great husband-and-wife couples.\\nIt's refreshing to see Denzel Washington (as Don Pedro) playing in a comedy. This may not be his first, but it's his best. With his better-known roles coming in films like GLORY and MALCOLM X, it's good to see Washington doing something lighter. He fits in perfectly with the rest of the cast, and race is never an issue. Casting him might have been one of Branagh's more daring moves in preparing this film. Happily, it works.\\nIf there was to be a poor job done, one would expect it to come from Keanu Reeves. Surprisingly perhaps, he acquits himself well in an admittedly small role (that of Don Pedro's bastard brother Don John, the villain of the story). There is fire in his eyes and his few lines are delivered with cold ruthlessness. On the other hand, Robert Sean Leonard's range is occasionally stretched, but the hiccups in his performance do nothing to damage the film.\\nVeterans Richard Briers and Brian Blessed, along with newcomer Kate Beckinsale, fill out the supporting roles with typical British flair. Michael Keaton is marvellous as the over-the-top Constable Dogberry. He's like something lifted from MONTY PYTHON, complete with THE HOLY GRAIL's galloping around on a non-existent horse.\\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is a gem of a movie--real find in 1993's sea of mediocrity. It's unfortunate that the film is unlikely to get a general release, but if the nearest theater showing it is a little further away than you normally travel, it's worth the trip. Easily the best film of the year to date, Kenneth Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is also one of the most entertaining and scintillating motion pictures to grace the screen in the past decade.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Starring: Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Paul Winfield Director: Renny Harlin Producer: Alan Marshall and Renny Harlin Screenplay: Michael France and Sylvester Stallone Music: Trevor Jones Released by Carolco through TriStar Pictures\\nGabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is a member of a mountain climbing rescue team. When one of his operations goes wrong and the girlfriend of his best friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) is killed, Gabe blames himself and leaves. Eight months later, after setting up a life in Denver, he returns to the mountains to persuade his lover Jessie (Janine Turner) to come with him. While he\\'s there, a call for help comes in and Gabe decides to become involved in one last rescue attempt. However, unknown to him, the rescue call is a fake, put out by a group of hijackers stranded in the mountains after the crash of their plane. Led by the psychotic Qualen (John Lithgow), they\\'re after three suitcases of money ($100,000,000) that are lost somewhere in the peaks and valleys of the Colorado Rockies.\\nHey, what\\'s a down-and-out street fighter from South Philly doing climbing mountains in a tee-shirt?\\nSeriously, though, Sylvester Stallone\\'s newest character may be named \"Gabe,\" but he takes an awful lot from the likes of men named \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo.\" There\\'s also a little of John McClane in him as well. This is not an original or interesting personae, and it shows what can happen when an actor becomes too-easily identified with one (or two) roles. To his credit, Stallone tried to do something different (two terrible comedies called OSCAR and STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT), but when the \"great experiment\" failed, he returned to the genre where he made his money. Whether CLIFFHANGER will bring Stallone\\'s name back into the top echelon of action movie stars has yet to be determined, but if this film can\\'t, the task may be impossible.\\nBefore I get too deeply into what inevitably will be a mostly-negative review, let me say that I enjoyed much of CLIFFHANGER on a purely mindless level. Although seriously flawed in many aspects, there\\'s enough action and adventure to keep just about anyone interested. CLIFFHANGER is the motion picture equivalent of a roller coaster--lots of thrills and chills without much substance, and almost immediately forgotten the moment it\\'s over. Unlike the roller coaster, however, this isn\\'t a ride you\\'re likely to take over and over again. Once is certainly enough.\\nThe first scene typifies the entire movie. There\\'s a lot of action and a fair degree of tension (even though it\\'s pretty obvious what\\'s going to happen). Stallone\\'s muscles are shown to their best advantage as he reaches out to save the life of a girl hanging by a thread. Bad dialogue abounds, as does lame acting. \"Please don\\'t let me die!\" begs the girl at least half-a-dozen times before plunging to her doom. This is not an example of a well-written dramatic moment, but it\\'s indicative of how all of CLIFFHANGER has been put together.\\nWhen the film goes for drama, it invariably fails. The dialogue is routine, frequently punctuated by cliches, and the character-building scenes do little more than waste time. One could argue that there\\'s not enough action in the picture because of these long, drawn-out sequences. They don\\'t work, so their inclusion damages CLIFFHANGER\\'s pace.\\nThe editing is suspect. The final product appears heavily cut. Numerous transition scenes have been trimmed in favor of the above-mentioned character moments. There are also several useless scenes featuring a couple of high school kids who have no purpose whatsoever in the overall storyline. I\\'m sure none of the expensive shots were eliminated, but the curious choice of what to use has given CLIFFHANGER an uneven tone.\\nThere are several moments of unintentional humor. Stallone\\'s Gabe is clearly someone with superhuman stamina. No real person could take the pounding that he does and stay alive, not to mention on his feet. This film makes DIE HARD look like a cakewalk. How many times can a person survive crashing into the side of a mountain or falling thirty feet into an ice-packed crevice? Suspension of disbelief is an issue. Some action films achieve this with little effort, but CLIFFHANGER too often struggles to entrance the audience. The fault lies mostly with the pedestrian script.\\nRenny Harlin showed in DIE HARD II that he has skill when it comes to directing action sequences. This ability is evident in CLIFFHANGER. Sure, the movie borrows from other action films (most notably the original DIE HARD), but it does so in a big, bold way, and there\\'s enough new stuff to keep scenes fresh. Unfortunately, as strong as Harlin is with the mountains and hardware, he\\'s that weak with the actors. He gets little out of them, seeming more interested in the next avalanche than a reasonably delivered line.\\nJohn Lithgow is surprisingly ineffective as the villain. Given his past track record, one would think he would be perfect to play the Alan Rickman clone (a smooth-talking, British-accented psychotic who\\'s out for the money). However, the role is woefully underplayed and Lithgow\\'s Qualen becomes the least-hated member of his group of thugs and mercenaries. CLIFFHANGER takes pains to make us loathe the bad guys, but it\\'s the ringleader that we have the least antipathy for.\\nWhat more can I say about CLIFFHANGER? If you\\'re in the mood for something that\\'s completely visceral and mindless (really mindless-- the plot is a joke, filled with contrivances and coincidences), this movie will fit the bill. Parts of it are excruciatingly bad, but there are numerous examples of well-directed action that, on balance, tend to make up for the worst gaffes. This is a poor man\\'s DIE HARD. It has the explosions, gunplay, and spectacular stunts, but little of the wit and intelligence. In other words, it\\'s a typical summer action flick.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: 5/28/93 Running Length: 1:50 Rated: PG-13 (Language, mature themes, sexual situations, brief nudity)\\nStarring: Whoopi Goldberg, Ted Danson, Nia Long, Will Smith, Jennifer Tilly Director: Richard Benjamin Producers: Arnon Milchan, Rick Bieber, and Michael Douglas Screenplay: Holly Goldberg Sloan Music: Mark Isham Released by Warner Brothers\\nAs a result of a simple science class blood test, Zora Matthews (Nia Long) discovers that the man she had long thought of as her father couldn\\'t be. After confronting her mother with this disarming truth, Sarah Matthews (Whoopi Goldberg) confesses to Zora that she is a product of artificial insemination. This sparks a quest for Zora to discover her real father. After getting the information from the sperm bank\\'s records, she goes to meet Hal Jackson (Ted Danson), and finds out that the man whose sperm her mother used is rude, crude, and, worst of all, white.\\nYeah, there are a lot of implausibilities in this script, but the story moves along snappily enough that most of them are easily overlooked. More difficult to miss is Richard Benjamin\\'s occasionally inadequate direction. There are numerous scenes that could have been a whole lot funnier had Benjamin been more deft in choreographing them. Too often, he is heavy-handed, but the film survives in spite of him.\\nThe first half of MADE IN AMERICA is highly amusing. Comedy is divided nicely between the outrageous and the subtle (although Bejamin likes to \"point out\" the less obvious moments by using tricks such as slow-motion). Unfortunately, the comic momentum fades as the film moves to a climax, with the big \"plot twist\" near the end seeming like something out of bad television melodrama. There are a lot of different ways that the story could have gone; the route it chooses is less-than-satisfying.\\nSurprisingly, although this is billed as a romantic comedy, I didn\\'t find the romance between Sarah and Hal of particular note. Despite the rumors linking Goldberg and Danson together off-screen, there doesn\\'t seem to be much chemistry between them. Far better are the interactions between mother and daughter, and father and daughter. I could believe these, which are at times touching and sweet, and on other occasions laced with bitterness.\\nThere\\'s no question that the best performance is given by Nia Long. Goldberg and Danson don\\'t have to stretch much to keep in character. Hal is little more than a southern extension of CHEERS\\' Sam Malone and Sarah Matthews echoes roles that Goldberg has played in the past (a politically correct African-American single mother). Jennifer Tilly has a minor role as Hal\\'s blond, airheaded, helium-voiced girlfriend. This seems to be a part that she was born to play. Never have I been more impressed with Ms. Tilly\\'s acting than when she stares into the camera with that vacuous expression.\\nOne of the failures of MADE IN AMERICA is in the way it introduces the two main characters. At the outset of the film, both Sarah and Hal are portrayed as irresponsible, arrogant, and thoroughly dislikeable. Although they soften as the story progresses, and the audience gradually warms to them, this is not a positive way to start a movie. It\\'s typical in a romantic comedy for one of the partners to be acerbic and unpleasant, but it\\'s unusual for this to be true of both of them. Had the comedy been less fresh, MADE IN AMERICA might have lost me early on.\\nAs far as comedies go, this one is above-average, primarily because there aren\\'t many clunkers among its jokes. Character development is so-so, and there are number of problems, some of which are significant, about the way the story progresses during the last half-hour. Overall, however, MADE IN AMERICA is enjoyable. It handles the issue of a mixed-race relationship sensitively (instead of sensationalistically) and presents an intriguing look at a very different family dynamic.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: 5/26/93 Running Length: 1:37 Rated: R (Language, violence, sexual situations, mature themes))\\nStarring: Tyrin Turner, Larenz Tate, Jada Pickett, Charles S. Dutton Directors: Allen and Albert Hughes Producer: Darin Scott Screenplay: Tyger Williams Music: QD III Released by New Line Cinema\\nAs a child, Caine (Tyrin Turner) was raised in a \"den of thieves,\" with a heroin-addicted mother and a gun-toting, drug-pushing father. At the age of five, Caine learns how to shoot a gun and witnesses his father kill someone in cold blood. By the time of his high school graduation, he\\'s already a seasoned drug pusher. One night, he and his friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate) go into a store to get a beer. O-Dog takes exception to a remark made by the owner and, with Caine standing by his side, guns the man down. From this point on, the pair start down a road of crime that nothing can rescue them from--not even the fear of death. In fact, when Caine\\'s grandfather asks him if he wants to stay alive, his response is, \"I don\\'t know.\"\\nThis will not be the only review written that compares MENACE II SOCIETY to BOYZ \\'N THE HOOD, but it may be the only one to liken the movie to RESERVOIR DOGS. As I see it, there are definite similarities between the Hughes Brother\\'s film and those of Singleton and Tarantino.\\nThe setting of MENACE and BOYZ is the same and the overwhelming specter of explosive violence hangs over both. Each in its own way is a powerful indictment of what life has become for a black man in the inner city and how the only escape through violence is into the grave. While BOYZ \\'N THE HOOD has as its main characters a couple of \"good\" kids, MENACE II SOCIETY focuses on the other side. Caine and O-Dog are criminals, given to using their guns to solve problems. Nevertheless, they are portrayed sympathetically and the audience comes to understand and even care about Caine, even though it\\'s impossible to endorse his actions. Hence the comparison to RESERVOIR DOGS, a movie that, among other things, had a group of murdering thugs as its main characters, and whose success depended on the audience making an emotional connection with the villains.\\nMENACE II SOCIETY has a number of lessons to teach, all of which are delivered without the whiff of a sermon. The story and characters are well-developed and we get to see graphically the wages of the kind of life that Caine and O-Dog have chosen. The lure of money, prestige, and power are realistically presented, but no moreso than the brutal payment that is exacted to obtain them. Also at issue is the necessity of a person accepting the consequences for his actions and how an apparently inconsequential event can trigger a disastrous chain-reaction.\\nThis is one of the most devastating movies to come along in a while. Few films these days have the power to keep an audience sitting in stunned silence for the first few seconds of the final credits. This, if nothing else, is testimony to how hard-hitting the conclusion of MENACE is. The movie pulls no punches, and for that reason, some viewers may be offended. The gory results of violence are displayed with little concern for the sensibilities of the less-hardened members of the audience, and the explicit language earns MENACE II SOCIETY its \"R\" rating before the opening New Line Cinema logo leaves the screen.\\nFor MENACE II SOCIETY to work, the characters have to be real. Especially in the case of Caine, into whose youth we are given a lingering look, they are. Equal credit must go to the writer and the actors. Except for Charles S. Dutton, whose role is little more than a two-scene cameo, none of the performers are well-known, but there isn\\'t a stiff in the bunch. The Hughes Brothers obviously knew what they wanted before going out and getting it.\\nFrankly, this is not an enjoyable movie. It\\'s too stark and powerful to function as simple entertainment. Those that set foot in a darkened theater showing MENACE II SOCIETY should prepare for something in the nature of an experience. It won\\'t be a fun time, but you\\'ll sit through ninety-seven minutes that won\\'t quickly be forgotten.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: M. Night Shyamalan, Mike Muthu, Christabel Howie, Richa Ahuja, Arun Balachandran Director: M. Night Shyamalan Producer: M. Night Shyamalan Screenplay: M. Night Shyamalan Music: Edmund K. Choi Released by Northern Arts Entertainment\\nDev Raman (M. Night Shyamalan) is an American-born Indian sent to India as part of a college student exchange program. Dev is reluctant to go, but his mother, to whom he is devoted, insists. So, friendless and alone, halfway across the world, Dev experiences culture shock--he may look like an Indian, but it is quickly and vividly demonstrated that looks are of little consequence, and it will take more than a glib tongue and an unwillingness to back down to earn acceptance and respect. In the midst of his initial travails, Dev\\'s sole friend is Sunjay (Mike Muthu), his guide and mentor, upon whose advice he relies. There are times, however, when he chooses to be headstrong and ignore Sunjay (on such issues as approaching a pretty girl or passively accepting the taunts of older students). Unsurprisingly, those incidents typically lead to embarrassment or worse.\\nStories about clashing cultures are nothing new to movies. In recent years, the subject has formed the basis for comedies (such as the wildly popular 1986 release CROCODILE DUNDEE, about an Australian transplanted to New York), science fiction (STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME, about a group from the twenty-third century coping with modern-day San Francisco), and numerous dramas (including 1992\\'s CITY OF JOY and MISSISSIPPI MASALA). Now, PRAYING WITH ANGER can be added to the list. The debut film of M. Night Shyamalan (who produced, directed, wrote, and starred), PRAYING WITH ANGER attempts to present another perspective on this issue.\\nComparisons with CITY OF JOY and MISSISSIPPI MASALA are appropriate. Like PRAYING WITH ANGER, both of those movies deal with friction between Indian and American traditions. However, where MASALA sets the story in the United States and CITY OF JOY makes the protagonist a white male adrift in Calcutta, PRAYING WITH ANGER sends an American born Indian to the \"home\" that he has never known.\\nThe film is at its best when it explores Indian culture and tradition, and examines how Dev must adjust to live in what for him is a strange world. These scenes, which make up a majority of the first half of PRAYING WITH ANGER, are often fascinating. Shyamalan doesn\\'t reveal anything extraordinary, but neither does he shrink from showing the often-painful rigidity imposed by India\\'s caste divisions. Social class is very much an issue, both as it applies to Dev and the people that he comes to care about.\\nUnfortunately, the basic plot is a series of formulas neatly bundled together. There\\'s the requisite tragic love story, the girl who bucks the centuries-old system, the outsider who comes to be respected by those who previously despised him, and, of course, the coming of age tale. PRAYING WITH ANGER lacks originality and inspiration, and after the initial interest has worn off, the story has a hard time holding the viewer\\'s attention. It\\'s always apparent what\\'s around the next corner, and the one after that as well.\\nShyamalan occasionally has problems with dialogue. Most of the time, the lines are okay, but there are moments when he launches into jarring, overblown sermon-like lectures. We do not, for example, need to have it explicitly and repeatedly pointed out how beautiful the traditions of India are when the camerawork places them adequately on display.\\nLike the dialogue, the characters are uneven. At times, the people in PRAYING WITH ANGER seem real, but there are occasions when they become foils for the plot. Dev\\'s sudden and complete transformation in the film\\'s final act is difficult to swallow, especially since we are never presented with enough evidence to justify such a radical swing in point-of-view.\\nTo the credit of M. Night Shyamalan, he strove for something lavish and ambitious in this, his first effort. While PRAYING WITH ANGER is not a total success, there are enough glimpses of promise to indicate that Shyamalan may have a fine future in film making. However, beyond those brief-but-sterling moments, PRAYING WITH ANGER relies on too much stock material for it to be satisfying enough to warrant more than a passing interest.\\n',\n",
              " \"Starring: Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Samantha Mathis, Fisher Stevens, Richard Edson Directors: Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel Producers: Jake Eberts and Roland Joffe Screenplay: Parker Bennett, Terry Runte, and Ed Solomon Music: Alan Silvestri Released by Hollywood Pictures\\n65 million years ago, when an asteroid crashed into the Earth and obliterated the dinosaurs, a parallel dimension was created in which dinosaurs evolved into the dominant creature. Now, millennia later, King Koopa (Dennis Hopper) of Dinohatten wants to fuse the two dimensions together so that he can expand his domain (and increase the food supply). There are two elements necessary to his plan: a small chip of the asteroid broken off upon impact and Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis), who lives in the other dimension and, coincidentally, wears the asteroid chip as a necklace. Koopa sends his incompetent cousins Iggy (Fisher Stevens) and Spike (Richard Edson) through the bridge between worlds to capture Daisy, who is in the process of falling for Luigi Mario (John Leguizamo), an apprentice plumber. When, after numerous mistakes, Iggy and Spike finally capture her and take her back to their dimension, Luigi and his brother Mario Mario (Bob Hoskins) go to her rescue.\\nDescribing the story of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is a difficult chore, considering how little intelligible plot there is. I suppose it's only natural to expect this, considering the source material for the movie. As we all know, arcade-style diversions are not known for strong, original storylines or well-developed characters. In that sense, this film is worthy of its inspiration.\\nThe fun of playing the video game is that you're involved--you control what the little figure on the screen does. With the movie, on the other hand, you're a bystander, sitting in a seat watching a bunch of actors run around getting absolutely nothing done and speaking dialogue that could have been written by a precocious five-year old. Following an unnecessarily long opening sequence (which is actually the best part of the movie), SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is ninety-odd minutes of pointless action sequences which serve little purpose other than to keep the motion picture faithful to the spirit of the game. In doing so, however, they commit the cardinal sin of boring the audience. With no genuine sense of danger, there's no excitement.\\nSome interesting casting choices were made. Bob Hoskins, who suddenly appears willing to lend his respected name to ventures of dubious quality, gives a solid-if-unspectacular performance as the older of the Mario brothers. John Leguizamo, on the other hand, is not good; earnestness doesn't compensate for lack of ability. Samantha Mathis, who has shown her skill in films such as PUMP UP THE VOLUME and THIS IS MY LIFE, plays an appealing, if somewhat gawky, college-aged princess. Dennis Hopper is disappointing. His role as King Koopa cries out for an over-the-top performance but, for some inexplicable reason, Hopper plays him straight, creating a dull and uncharismatic villain. This guy is so boring that we find it difficult to root against him--that is, when we can unravel enough of the murky plot to figure out why we're not supposed to like him.\\nAdmittedly, the visual effects are nice, but it's a poor movie these days that can't have that said about it. There isn't anything new or revolutionary here. Back in 1979, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE proved that special effects alone, no matter how impressive, cannot sustain the interest of an audience. What was true then remains so today. SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is all glitz and no substance, and makes for a pretty poor time at the movies. If you crave excitement and action, see CLIFFHANGER.\\nKids will probably love this film but, to be frank, most children aren't that discriminating (apologies to the few who are). There's nothing in the film that's reprehensible (although some may find the concept of a one-hundred-five-minute commercial for a game offensive in itself), but I find it hard to believe that many adults accompanying their youngsters will be entertained.\\nIn general, about the best recommendation I can come up with regarding this movie is to turn on the Nintendo and play a game yourself. You'll have more fun, spend less money, and it will be over a whole lot faster.\\n\",\n",

His time of solitude comes to an end, however, when his good friend and former superior, Colonel Denton Walters (Richard Crenna), is captured by Saddam Hussein, and a sexy female CIA operative (Brenda Bakke) arrives at the monastery to recruit Topper for the rescue mission. Biceps bulging and guns blazing, Topper charges into Iraq, letting nothing get in his way.\\nTwo years ago, I gave the original HOT SHOTS! a scathing review, calling it \"one of the most unfunny and sophomoric movies\" of the year. Fortunately, while PART DEUX is just as silly and dumb as it predecessor, it manages a more humorous edge. As a result, the sequel is more watchable than the original. Better than the actual film, however, is its theatrical trailer, which shows a number of scenes not in the finished product (they look to have been produced explicitly for the trailer).\\nWhat HOT SHOTS! did for TOP GUN, PART DEUX does for the Rambo movies. Charlie Sheen has bulked up impressively for this role and, with unbound hair hanging to his shoulders and ammo encasing his body, he looks eerily like the posters of Sylvester Stallone from the second and third FIRST BLOODs. Then there\\'s Richard Crenna, here in a role that\\'s obviously a sendup of the one he played in the other series. Of course, PART DEUX doesn\\'t stop with Rambo, getting its digs in at dozens of other targets ranging from the easily-lampooned BASIC INSTINCT to LADY AND THE TRAMP.\\nBad puns, double entendres, and dumb sight gags abound (what else would you expect from Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft?). With as many as there are, it\\'s only to be expected that quite a few are duds. Unfortunately, a disproportionate number of the failures occur during the last third of the movie, causing PART DEUX to be unbalanced. The first hour is decently paced as the humor keeps it afloat, but the final portion of the film is occasionally tedious.\\nThere are a couple of real winners in PART DEUX. Most memorable are a cameo by Martin Sheen, a spoof of SEA HUNT featuring the original star (Lloyd Bridges), a slapstick gathering of the living presidents, and an on-screen digital \"body count\" meter during the climactic raid on Saddam\\'s fortress.\\nSheen and Golino wade through this film with gloriously deadpan expressions, playing it straight no matter how outlandish the story becomes. As is true of Leslie Nielsen in the NAKED GUN pictures, this is one of the film\\'s assets. Satire often works best when it\\'s intentionally modelled after bad drama. Oddly enough, one wonders if the Rambo films were the best choice for a spoof, since the second and third installments came close to self-parody in their own right.\\nNevertheless, not enough of PART DEUX gels to make it an unqualified success, even for its genre. There are too many instances when the film is too obvious in its attempts at humor. Forcing jokes more often leads to them falling flat than working and, in PART DEUX, this happens on several occasions.\\nThose that enjoyed the original HOT SHOTS! will doubtless be entertained by the second part, as will moviegoers who laughed their way through LOADED WEAPON ONE. The stuff of PART DEUX is not AIRPLANE material, but it has its high points, and as a mindless summer evening out, it will certainly deliver what\\'s expected from it.\\n',\n",
              " 'Fifteen years ago, Michael Chapman (Michael J. Fox) was a pint-sized TV superstar, the wisecracking cute kid on a sitcom called LIFE WITH MIKEY. Now, long after leaving professional acting behind, he and his brother Ed (Nathan Lane) run a talent agency for children with marginal-to-nonexistent ability. Their fortunes are sinking quickly until Michael runs into ten-year-old pickpocket Angie Vega on the street. So impressed is he by the performance she gives when she\\'s caught lifting some guy\\'s wallet that he invites her to the agency for an audition.\\nEvery summer movie season has its blockbuster duds; surprise hits; and dull, brainless, formula \"family films\" guaranteed to fall between the cracks. LIFE WITH MIKEY belongs firmly in the third category. This is a vapid film, with little to recommend it save its lack of anything offensive. The draw is that parents can take their offspring to the theater without fear of hearing a string of profanity, seeing someone get shot or mauled, or being bombarded by half-naked women running across the screen. Unfortunately, such \"wholesomeness\" is not nearly enough reason to spend money and time on LIFE WITH MIKEY.\\nActually, this looks more like a made-for-TV movie than something developed for theatrical release (although, from the start, it was always intended for the big screen). The production quality is low and the script a product of the plot-by-numbers division of Hollywood. Little more intelligence has been put into the main story than was included in the intentionally-awful clips we see from LIFE WITH MIKEY.\\nSomething interesting in the premise got lost in the movie\\'s transition from an idea to the final product. Having Michael J. Fox play a kid-star who becomes a nothing as an adult (no money, no recognition, and no self-respect) is a potentially-intriguing prospect, but LIFE WITH MIKEY does little to build on this theme. Instead, it spends most of its time on the barbed-tongue wrangling between Michael and his discovery. This is the umpteenth movie in which the child melts the heart of a cynical adult while the adult shows her/him that someone cares. It\\'s a tale that Hollywood has done to death, and this movie has nothing to add to it.\\nOne of the few surprises about LIFE WITH MIKEY is the movie\\'s lack of energy. Caused by a combination of \"mail-in-the-performance\" acting, poor directing, a routine music score (by Alan Menken, who seems to get worse with every soundtrack), and pedestrian camerawork, the sense of lethargy pervades every scene, threatening to lull the unsuspecting viewer to sleep. There are a couple of funny moments, but they neither last long nor are they memorable enough to recall after the final credits roll.\\nMichael J. Fox has never been a great comic actor, but he usually does an adequate job (as in BACK TO THE FUTURE and DOC HOLLYWOOD). Not so in LIFE WITH MIKEY. Perhaps he\\'s trying to parody himself as an ex-young TV star, but his character comes across as completely unconvincing. Christina Vidal, a newcomer, supplies the only brief bursts of liveliness available in this otherwise-stagnant picture, but she still has a lot of rough edges. Too often, it\\'s plain that she\\'s acting.\\nLIFE WITH MIKEY is a subpar piece of film making for which the producers\\' intentions are all-too-apparent. In slapping together a formula-riddled picture, they hope to cash in on the early-summer family-oriented audience (those that are questing for something to see before the re-release of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES). Considering the creative limitations of this project, such blatant marketing is patently offensive. Those with a yen to see something for the whole family can find hundreds of better offerings on video, and fans of Michael J. Fox would do better to peruse old episodes of FAMILY TIES. At least back then, he appeared to care about what he was doing.\\n',\n",
              " 'David Greenhill (Don Johnson) is about to go on trial for the murder of his rich socialite wife. To prepare his defense, he solicits one of the best young female lawyers in the country, Jennifer Haines (Rebecca DeMornay). After an initial bout of reluctance, Jennifer decides to take the case--she realizes that David is a womanizer and manipulator, but she believes him to be innocent (\"People who are guilty are rarely this blunt,\" she confesses) and sees his case as a challenge. However, from the moment she accepts him as a client, she finds herself in over her head as David, obviously not possessing the most stable of personalities, begins to toy with her personal life-- and her mind.\\nTrials and questions of guilt and innocence are nothing new, but GUILTY AS SIN has a few twists that give this film a different slant than many other courtroom thriller/dramas. Limited though it is, the strength of this picture lies not in a tense verbal jousting match between prosecuting and defense attorneys, because there isn\\'t one, nor is it to be found in the \"did he do it/didn\\'t he\" theme, since the truth is revealed relatively early. Instead, the centerpiece is the cat-and-mouse game played between Jennifer and David as the two twist and manipulate circumstances, people, and each other. Much of the story, while admittedly overplotted, is cleverly-conceived and fun to watch. That\\'s what makes the ending such a colossal disappointment.\\nOften, the final act of a film has little impact on the overall quality of the product. There are a number of good films that have weak conclusions, and a few horrible movies that surprise with unexpectedly-solid wrap-ups. GUILTY AS SIN, however, is an example of how an ending can ruin the entire picture. Without revealing anything plot-wise, let me simply state the final moments lead to an inept and feeble letdown. Everything that was carefully developed during the first ninety-five minutes is thrown away in the last ten. It\\'s almost as if someone different was brought in to do the writing. What\\'s worse is that it\\'s easy to construct scenarios that would have made a fitting conclusion to an otherwise-intriguing and entertaining film.\\nWhile the end of GUILTY AS SIN is by far the film\\'s most grievous fault, it is by no means the only sour point. Some of the dialogue could have used a re-write or two. There are a number of lines that are unintentionally funny, and this is a bad sign for a movie trying to develop tension. There\\'s also a truly horrible performance given by Stephen Lang, who fails to infuse his Phil Garson (Jennifer\\'s lover) with anything remotely resembling humanity. Fortunately, he doesn\\'t have a large role.\\nRebecca DeMornay is inconsistent. There are scenes when she does an excellent job, but an equal number when she is amateurish, stilted, or unconvincing. She\\'s at her best playing someone of cool, ruthless intelligence and at her worst attempting to give an impression of vulnerability. Strong emotion appears to be something that she has difficulty portraying effectively.\\nDon Johnson, on the other hand, is wildly charismatic as David Greenhill. He plays the role to the hilt, pulling out all the stops and more than occasionally overacting. What he does is perfect for the movie, and immensely fun to watch (it also helps to erase the memory of an execrable performance in Born Yesterday). There aren\\'t many movies when I find myself sympathizing with the villain, but this is among the exceptions, Johnson\\'s acting putting me solidly in Greenhill\\'s corner. Oddly enough, another recent example of this occurred when I rooted for DeMornay\\'s Paige in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.\\nComparisons can be made to JAGGED EDGE, but most of the similarities are superficial. Aside from EDGE being a better-crafted piece of entertainment, there\\'s a lot to differentiate the two. While it\\'s true that Jack Warden\\'s character in GUILTY AS SIN is uncannily like Robert Loggia\\'s in EDGE, and that in both films there\\'s a strange attraction between the female lawyer and a client that she believes to be innocent, each of the movies focuses on something different. GUILTY AS SIN pushes Greenhill\\'s guilt or innocence into the background, along with his trial, to zero in on his bizarre and weirdly fascinating relationship with Jennifer.\\nGUILTY AS SIN will not win any awards for realism, but as escapism it\\'s fine--until the ending, that is. It\\'s disappointing and amazing how a few ill-conceived pages of script can shatter what might otherwise have been a shallow-but-enjoyable thriller. What a waste.\\n',\n",
              " 'What starts as a simple village squabble gets escalated rapidly in THE STORY OF QUI JU. The movie starts with Qui (Gong Li) taking her injured husband Qailing (Liu Pei Qi) to see the doctor. He has just had a fight with the village chief (Lei Lao Sheng), who beat him up. When Qui goes to the authorities to seek recompense for her husband\\'s injury, she receives little in the way of satisfaction. While they are willing to grant Qailing monetary compensation, they will not compel the chief to apologize, which is what Qui really wants. So, despite an advanced pregnancy, she begins a series of long treks to distant districts and cities in an attempt to attain justice.\\nAt times, THE STORY OF QUI JU is a bitingly amusing satire on the process commonly known as the \"bureaucratic runaround\". This film goes to new extremes to lampoon a process that can make righteous satisfaction a difficult thing to come by. Throughout the film, all Qui wants is a simple apology, but the lengths that she has to go to, and the money that she has to spend, in an attempt to secure it, is astonishing. In the end, we\\'re treated to the most bitter irony of all.\\nUnfortunately, while QUI JU is sporadically funny, it is also slow-moving to the point of distraction. There is too much back-and-forth, and the story begins to drag well before the halfway point. Boring is too extreme a term for the film since there are a number of memorable highlights, but there are occasions when THE STORY OF QUI JU may lose the attention of some of its viewers.\\nIf there was no other reason to see this picture, at least it can be cited as a good lesson in some of the cultural distinctions of rural mainland China. It\\'s refreshing to get an insider\\'s view in a film not specifically intended for outsiders. This way, we see things in a normal, natural setting, not as staged moments designed to impress foreigners. There are times when this aspect of the film almost makes up for the plodding pace.\\nDirector Zhang Yimou and actress Gong Li have been reunited for the third time (they previously worked together in JU DOU and RAISE THE RED LANTERN). Li\\'s style of acting is marvelously fresh and entirely different from anything originating in a Western country. Her performance is understated, and effective because of it. There is never any sense of melodrama, and Qui\\'s subtle displays of exasperation at the lengths to which she must go to get a fair hearing are completely believable.\\nNot only does QUI JU tackle the issue of bureaucracy, but it also takes pains to point out the dangers of pride. Whatever ego Qui has is minimal. She doesn\\'t want revenge; she wants justice; and she\\'s willing to go to any lengths to obtain it. The village chief, on the other hand, is willing to do anything except apologize, and this is where the crux of the conflict lies. Were he a little less stubborn, Qui\\'s actions would be unnecessary.\\nFor those who enjoy pictures with little action, a minimalist plot, decent characterization, and a good eye for small details, THE STORY OF QUI JU may be worthwhile viewing. Beware that this is a very un-American movie--everything about it is distinctly foreign--and perhaps its greatest value lies in what it can teach. Nevertheless, the pace of QUI JU borders on ponderous, so a reasonable attention span is requisite. There are rewards to be had from a viewing of Zhang Yimou\\'s latest, but they don\\'t come without a price.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: 6/11/93; wide release 6/18/93 Running Length: 1:58 Rated: R (Language, violence, sex, mature themes)\\nStarring: Angela Bassett, Laurence Fishburne Director: Brian Gibson Producers: Doug Chapin and Barry Krost Screenplay: Kate Lanier, based on I, TINA, by Tina Turner and Kurt Loder Music: Stanley Clarke Released by Touchstone Pictures\\nWHAT\\'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a biographical sketch of the life of Tina Turner (played by Angela Bassett), concentrating on the years between the late 1950s and the early 1980s. The focus is primarily on Ms. Turner\\'s disastrous marriage to Ike Turner (Larry Fishburne), the man who created her career while nearly destroying her life. Her struggles to escape from under his abusive thumb and make it on her own fuel this surprisingly effective film.\\nGoing into the movie, I have to admit that I wasn\\'t optimistic. It\\'s all-too-easy to put together an exploitative film based on the life of a well-known musical figure or group, and foist it on an unsuspecting public. Oliver Stone proved with THE DOORS that just because someone in the music business is surrounded by controversy, that doesn\\'t mean that his or her life will translate into an enjoyable motion picture. However, where I found the story of Jim Morrison\\'s life to be dull and pretentious, I discovered energy and passion in WHAT\\'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.\\nThe music scenes are electric. Superbly acted and choreographed, they are some of the best of their kind to be found in any recent movie. While the voice of Tina Turner covers all her own songs, it\\'s impossible to tell that Angela Bassett\\'s voice is being dubbed out. Laurence Fishburne does his own singing. The choice of music for the soundtrack is also noteworthy; many of the songs will be familiar to even those who have had limited exposure to Ike and Tina Turner.\\nPunctuating the film\\'s energized performances are several darkly violent scenes. These are frighteningly intense and starkly graphic, not because they are especially bloody (although blood is in evidence), but because the participants do such an excellent job at bringing to the surface highly- believable emotions during the circumstances. Often, abuse scenes are over-dramatized, but WHAT\\'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT avoids that trap. The goal of realism is attained.\\nAngela Bassett, who was Betty Shabazz in MALCOLM X, plays an outstanding Tina Turner. Physically, she bears only a passing resemblance to the singer (this is reinforced when Turner makes a brief appearance in the final moments of the film during a concert), but she has the mannerisms, vocal patterns, and explosive energy captured perfectly.\\nLarry Fishburne was already widely-known and well-respected coming into WHAT\\'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, but his performance as Ike Turner will enhance his reputation. He gets to play the hero and the villain--the slickly charismatic singer transformed by jealousy and drugs into a brutal beast. Any Jekyll and Hyde personae demands ability and range, both elements of which Fishburne exhibits. His Ike Turner has many facets, transcending the level of the common \"bad husband\" (much as his character in DEEP COVER gave that movie more substance than the script strove for).\\nWHAT\\'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is an exceptionally-paced movie. Credit director Brian Gibson for this. He avoids the tendency of biographies to get mired in irrelevancies. The film, nearly two hours long, seems much shorter than its running length. Gibson also manages to neatly transition his project through the turbulent decades of the sixties and seventies, effectively capturing the essence of those eras. It\\'s not just the costumes and hairdos that reflect the times, but the attitudes of the participants as well.\\nYou don\\'t have to be a Tina Turner fan to appreciate this movie, but no matter how you feel about her music, WHAT\\'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT cannot fail to impart an impression of her courage and inner strength. Although ultimately a triumphant story, this biography doesn\\'t see its subject through rose-colored glasses. It takes chances, and that\\'s why the movie works. Visually impressive and aurally dazzling, WHAT\\'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a great alternative to some of the bloated, overbudgeted summer films.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Laura Dern, Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards Director: Stephen Spielberg Producers: Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen Screenplay: Michael Crichton and David Koepp based on the book by Michael Crichton Music: John Williams Released by Universal Pictures\\nOn a small island off the coast of Costa Rica exists a most unusual animal preserve by the name of Jurassic Park. Operated by dinosaur lover John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), Jurassic Park is the first of its kind. Its population of creatures includes brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, tricerotops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, each of which has been cloned using the latest technology that takes DNA from dinosaur-biting prehistoric insects preserved in amber, and uses that DNA for the re- creation. When the consortium funding Jurassic Park become concerned that all is not as it should be, Hammond is forced to call in three experts: paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his partner, paleo-botanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and the brilliant-but-cynical mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When the trio arrives at Jurassic Park, they are astonished by what it represents. It doesn\\'t take long, however, for astonishment to turn to horror.\\nFirst of all, for anyone who\\'s wondering, given the current state of technology, the situation postulated in JURASSIC PARK cannot happen. Not only do the necessary cloning techniques not exist, but the likelihood of retrieving dinosaur DNA from an amber-encased prehistoric mosquito is extremely small. While insect specimens have been unearthed, for there to be dinosaur DNA, circumstances demand that the mosquito had bitten a dinosaur shortly before its fatal imprisonment, and the chance of that is slim, at best.\\nNevertheless, the enjoyment of any movie is hardly predicated by a factual premise. The apparent realism of some of Crichton\\'s pseudo-science imbues JURASSIC PARK with a grounding that is acceptable in our high-tech world. After all, to weave a dinosaur fable in this day and age, science--not fantasy--must be the driving force. The science may not be real, but it must sound good enough to allow a suspension of disbelief. In that, this film (and the book that spawned it) succeeds.\\nOf course, the special effects help immensely. They are so good, in fact, and the dinosaurs look so real, that I half expected to see \"dinosaur trainer\" during the closing credits. Instead, however, honor should be heaped upon the creators of JURASSIC PARK\\'s primary screen presences (all apologies to the actors). Stan Winston, definitely not a stranger to this sort of film (his recent credits include ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2), is credited with the live-action creatures. Dennis Muren gets his due for the full motion monsters. Phil Tippett is the \"dinosaur supervisor\", and Michael Lantieri presides over the creature effects. All-in-all, the wizards at ILM have done an outstanding job, giving us by far the most impressive and believable monster movie of all time. Nothing compares.\\nWould that the story is the equal of its execution. To begin with, Crichton\\'s book, while filled with fascinating ideas and entertaining moments, hardly holds together as a top-of-the-line adventure story. The ending is especially problematic, resulting in a forty-page denouement that drags slowly to an anticlimactic conclusion. As a result, a script based closely on the book is bound to suffer from some of the same problems. Despite numerous small changes and omissions, the movie JURASSIC PARK is very much faithful to its printed inspiration. Perhaps Michael Crichton\\'s involvement in the screenplay has something to do with this.\\nThe biggest weakness of the novel is characterization, and the same flaw is fully evident in the screen adaptation. There are a few exceptions. The scenes between Alan and Ellie at the beginning are well-done, with the affection between them evident from the start (a change from the book, where the two were never a couple). This is as much a tribute to the acting of Sam Neill and Laura Dern as to the writing. Also noteworthy is a scene where Ellie confronts Hammond, who\\'s eating a dish of ice cream in the midst of the crisis. Here, we get a sense of what\\'s going on inside the old man\\'s head. In the book, he\\'s a mixed-up fanatic, but in the film, he\\'s made into a sympathetic, albeit eccentric, figure.\\nInterestingly, some transposition has gone on between Hammond\\'s two grandchildren. Tim (Joseph Mazzello) is still the dinosaur-lover, but the screen\\'s version of the boy is younger than his sister Alexis (Ariana Richards). The flip-flop in age creates a difference in their relationship and they come across as closer and less-adversarial on screen. Also, here it\\'s Alexis, not Tim, who\\'s the computer whiz.\\nThe plot is little more than a cleverly jumbled-together batch of formulas. As I mentioned before, JURASSIC PARK is, reduced to its most basic level, a monster movie. Thrown in for good measure is the human interest story--the growing relationship between self-confessed child-hater Grant and his two youthful charges--but this part of the film worked least successfully for me. Also, there isn\\'t an effective ending. Too much is left dangling, demanding that the lion\\'s share of the resolution be confined to the imagination, but at least the movie avoids the book\\'s plodding conclusion.\\nNevertheless, I doubt that there are many who will go to JURASSIC PARK for its characters or story. Rightly so, crowds will flock to the theaters screening this movie so they can ooh and aah, jump in their seats, and root for the overmatched humans against the big, bad dinosaurs. When it comes to adventure, JURASSIC PARK is a roller-coaster ride. With thrills and action in the tradition of, but not up to the level of, ALIENS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (another Spielberg picture), this is an exciting and energetic film with a number of shocks but few letdowns. Even those familiar with the written work can\\'t help being drawn in to the pulse- pounding exhilaration of the chase as the Tyrannosaurus menaces two powerless electric cars and the trapped humans inside.\\nIn the end, JURASSIC PARK succeeds because it\\'s good entertainment--a fun night at the movies. Unlike something of the ilk of CLIFFHANGER, which also boasts a lot of action, there\\'s some intelligence behind this picture. JURASSIC PARK isn\\'t great art, nor is it classic cinema, but at least we don\\'t feel like the producers and director are more interested in getting as much firepower and death on-screen as they can without giving a thought as to whether anyone in the audience has a brain.\\nNot having seen all of the summer\\'s offerings (THE LAST ACTION HERO is still a week away), I can\\'t say how JURASSIC PARK will rate overall, but I will admit that, in my opinion, this is the first big-budget film in a long time to live up to its pre-release reputation. Sure, the movie isn\\'t perfect, but it delivers--perhaps more than delivers--what the average viewer will expect from it. Summer has long been known as the season for action/adventure films, and JURASSIC PARK falls firmly into that category.\\nBecause of the nature and scope of this movie, I would encourage anyone with more than a passing interest to catch JURASSIC PARK in a movie theater. It will lose a lot on the smaller TV screen. Without the grandeur of a stereophonic sound system and sizeable picture, much of this film\\'s impact will dwindle away. The dinosaurs will still look real, but there will undoubtedly be some who, upon viewing JURASSIC PARK on video, will wonder what all the fuss is about.\\nTo this praise, let me add a final word of caution. While the violence in this film is not particularly graphic, it is apparent. People aren\\'t shown getting gored or ripped apart, but the movie makes it perfectly clear what is happening. Parents considering taking young children (under around 10 years of age) to JURASSIC PARK might be advised to see the film first. There are certainly a number of scary and potentially-disturbing moments which, while they add to the spice for older viewers, may be inappropriate for younger ones.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: 6/18/93 Running Length: 2:10 Rated: PG-13 (Violence)\\nStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Austin O\\'Brien, Charles Dance, Anthony Quinn, F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Mercedes Reuhl Director: John McTiernan Producers: Steve Roth and John McTiernan Screenplay: Shane Black and David Arnott based on a story by Zak Penn and Adam Leff Music: Michael Kamen Released by Columbia Pictures\\nDanny (Austin O\\'Brien) is addicted to Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) movies. He\\'s seen the third one six times and now he\\'s eagerly awaiting the released of JACK SLATER IV. When his elderly friend Nick (Robert Prosky), the projectionist at a run-down theater, tells Danny that he can sneak him in for an advance screening of the new flick, the kid is excited. The next day, when he arrives at the appointed hour (midnight, when all strange things happen), Nick lets him in and presents him with a \"magic\" ticket. There\\'s a long story that goes with this, the gist of which is that the ticket purportedly has the ability to transport its user to other worlds, but it has a \"mind of its own\". Soon after Danny sits down to enjoy the movie, he discovers exactly what Nick meant by that phrase. The seat in the safe comfort of the theater suddenly becomes the floor of Jack Slater\\'s car. Danny is no longer watching the movie--he\\'s in it.\\nThe critics have panned LAST ACTION HERO and, given my propensity for blasting anything that bills Arnold Schwarzenegger as its main attraction, one might assume that I didn\\'t enjoy it either. Not so. While LAST ACTION HERO certainly isn\\'t the banner movie of the summer, it\\'s not nearly as horrible as most of the radio/TV/print reviewers would like you to believe.\\nAdmittedly, this is not a good action film. Given its billing, director, and title, that\\'s a surprise. On the other hand, LAST ACTION HERO works as an unexpectedly witty comedy. In fact, I found this movie to be more amusing (not to mention more watchable) than Schwarzenegger\\'s two openly billed comic entries, TWINS and KINDERGARTEN COP.\\nThe humor ranges from that staple of the action genre--bad puns--to some pretty incisive satire. Even though this next assertion is going to cause a lot of people to cringe, I\\'ll make it anyway. I can find a number of similarities between LAST ACTION HERO and (believe it or not) Robert Altman\\'s THE PLAYER. No, this isn\\'t nearly as nasty or intelligent a picture as the Spring 1992 release, but both movies have a lot of fun blasting Hollywood genre films. Arnold\\'s production may be more good-natured about it (after all, he\\'s made his name and most of his fortune out of these kind of popcorn-and-soda movies), but there\\'s no mistaking the intent. There\\'s hardly a plot device of the action film that goes without some kind of dig. The car chase, the shoot-out, the exploding vehicles and houses, the death-defying jumps, the triumph over impossible odds, the last-second escape--all of these, and more, get lampooned in LAST ACTION HERO.\\nOn the other hand, there is fundamental problem in the movie--the action sequences, which are numerous, are not exciting. Sure, they\\'re directed with flair and energy, but the certain knowledge that nothing remotely bad is going to happen to Arnold or his pint-sized sidekick takes away any possible suspense. McTiernan has given us a lot of flashes and bangs, but, aside from the laughs generated by the parodies, there isn\\'t much for us to sink our teeth into. The pulse-pounding, sizzling pull of a DIE HARD is absent.\\nPlot problems abound, but at least the story is more coherent than CLIFFHANGER. Since it\\'s a fantasy, a great deal (such as the horrible plot device of the ticket) can be forgiven, although there are several instances where LAST ACTION HERO violates its own terms for inner consistency. Some of the things that go on in JACK SLATER IV, a live-action cartoon, are enjoyable. There\\'s an incredibly over-the-top car chase (with cars flying off bridges and landing safely far below) that\\'s a lot of fun (too bad most of the other action scenes aren\\'t as memorable). However, before the setting switches to the \"real world\", the pacing becomes sluggish. Once the freshness of the satire has worn off, everything becomes routine.\\nBack in New York, things get revitalized for a while. We get to see Arnold play himself as something of a shallow, media hog who is pushed around by his wife (Maria Shriver, playing herself). It\\'s to Schwarzenegger\\'s credit that he doesn\\'t shrink away from self-mockery. In fact, given the opportunity, he launches himself whole-heartedly into it.\\nThe ending of LAST ACTION HERO is pathetic. By the last fifteen minutes, the uniqueness and fun have all drained away, and there\\'s nothing in the climax to liven things up. Perhaps if the villains (a one-eyed sharpshooter named Benedict, played by Charles Dance, and a homicidal lunatic called only \"The Slasher\", played by Tom Noonan) had been more charismatic, the usual end-of-the-film heroics would have been enjoyable, but these are not the kind of bad guys that the audience can really enjoy hating. This is especially disappointing, since McTiernan directed Alan Rickman\\'s standout performance as the slick-tongued, despicable nasty in DIE HARD.\\nThere\\'s also an interesting plot thread that\\'s not developed at all. Using the magic ticket, it\\'s possible to bring any screen character to life in the real world. Imagine what the film could have been like with Draculas, Terminators, and all sorts of other unworldly creatures roaming around. Alas, the device is hardly used.\\nAs with THE PLAYER (and a number of other recent movies), cameos abound. The likes of James Belushi, Sharon Stone, Hammer, and Jean-Claude Van Damme make appearances. There are also countless references and homages to movies both old and new. The best wedding of a tribute with a cameo involves Joan Plowright, the widow of the late Laurence Olivier. As a school-teacher introducing her class to a clip from Olivier\\'s HAMLET, the eminent British actress tells the students that they might recognize Olivier from CLASH OF THE TITANS.\\nAlso notable in the area of takeoffs is Schwarzenegger\\'s portrayal of a gun-toting Hamlet, although most of this sequence has been shown in the previews, so there\\'s little new for theatrical viewing. There\\'s also a running gag involving the line \"I\\'ll be back\" but, again, the key scene is in the trailers and TV ads.\\nAs usual, Arnold is far more impressive as a screen presence than an actor. He has a certain style that lends itself to action and comedy. On those rare occasions when he\\'s forced to do a straight, semi-dramatic scene (such as when Slater recalls a rooftop tragedy that happened in his past), Schwarzenegger\\'s performance comes across with a dull thud. Please don\\'t let anyone risk putting this man in a serious movie!\\nThe musical score by Michael Kamen, which consists primarily of a lot of loud hard rock combined with a few bars of classical, is far too intrusive. For the most part, music, much like camerawork, should be a background element in a movie. In LAST ACTION HERO, it\\'s very much in the foreground.\\nKids will like this movie. While it\\'s true that there\\'s a lot of violence in LAST ACTION HERO, none of it is graphic. The explosions, gunplay, and killings are no more extreme than anything shown on a violent television cops-and-robbers show. Unlike JURASSIC PARK, there\\'s nothing here that\\'s likely to cause nightmares for anyone over the age of eight (or thereabouts).\\nMaybe LAST ACTION HERO won\\'t be able to top JURASSIC PARK at the box office, but I don\\'t expect it to be a disaster, either. For my money, this movie is one of Arnold\\'s better recent offerings (With the possible exception of TOTAL RECALL, about which I have mixed feelings, I haven\\'t been enamored with much of what he\\'s done since the original TERMINATOR). Comparisons to HUDSON HAWK are undeserved. The same tongue-in-cheek style is evident, but this is a vastly superior effort.\\nLAST ACTION HERO is a fun movie, and most of Arnold\\'s large legion of fans will be pleased by what he\\'s given them. The number of people who hate this film will probably be dwarfed by those who enjoy it, and critical opinion rarely makes much difference with this sort of picture. No one is going to call LAST ACTION HERO a great film, but it provides a decent two hours worth of entertainment (it\\'s about ten to fifteen minutes too long), and that\\'s a lot better than many of 1993\\'s offerings.\\n',\n",

Lenkov Screenplay: Fax Bahr, Adam Small, and Shawn Schepps based on a story by Patrick J. Clifton, Susan McMartin, and Peter M. Lenkov Music: Richard Gibbs Released by Hollywood Pictures\\nFollowing graduation from a small school in Midwestern America, Rebecca Warner (Carla Gugino) opts for a change. Instead of sticking close to home, she wants to go to college in Southern California. Although her father Walter (Lane Smith) and mother Connie (Cindy Pickett) are uncertain about the idea, they agree that it\\'s Becca\\'s life, and make the two-day drive to her new school. There they encounter her Residential Advisor, Crawl (Pauly Shore). The next time the Warners meet Crawl, it\\'s when he comes home for Thanksgiving with Rebecca. The person who gets off the plane isn\\'t the same shy, reserved girl that left three months ago, but her change in attitude and appearance isn\\'t the only surprise she has in store for her family. In order to get out of marrying an old boyfriend (Dan Gauthier), she pretends to be engaged to Crawl.\\nSome people like Pauly Shore (mostly teenagers, I suspect). After all, if those people didn\\'t exist, SON-IN-LAW would have never been made. Clearly, the role of Crawl was scripted specifically for him. Oddly enough, with someone marginally less annoying, this could have been a somewhat charming, albeit predictable, film. But to put Shore in a romantic comedy is asking for trouble.\\nThere are times when it almost works, but most of those occasions are when he abandons his stupid stage personae and does something that approaches acting. Unfortunately, there are too few of those moments and, as soon as they pass, the aggravating side of Mr. Shore quickly re-surfaces. There are times when it becomes exceptionally difficult to accept--not to mention like--the character of Crawl.\\nThe film has its humorous scenes, but these are formula-driven and lacking in originality. Perhaps the most inventive moment of SON-IN-LAW comes as the result of a cameo by Brenden Frasier, reprising the role he played in last summer\\'s dud, ENCINO MAN. It says something about the rest of this film to site that as one of SON-IN-LAW\\'s highlights.\\nThe plot is stock romantic comedy material, complete with the usual misunderstandings, break-ups, and resolutions. The ending of SON-IN-LAW is so sickeningly sweet that I almost went into sugar shock. This gives an entirely new meaning to the term \"happy ending.\" Blech. I\\'m not against happy endings in general, but this kind of sappiness is impossible to stomach.\\nCarla Gugino, who has the somewhat thankless role of Rebecca, does a fine job with the material she\\'s been given. In many ways, she reminds me of Kimberly Williams (Steve Martin\\'s daughter in the remake of FATHER OF THE BRIDE). Both have a certain freshness that\\'s enjoyable to watch. This is especially true of Gugino in this film, where she mercifully gives us a stable counterbalance to Shore\\'s idiotic antics.\\nSince SON-IN-LAW takes place on a farm, there exists the usual run of city-boy-out-of-his-element gags. Of course, there\\'s a cow milking scene, and Shore gets to feed the pigs, pluck a turkey, and try his hand at fishing. It\\'s all pretty routine stuff. The few laughs garnered by this line of tried-and-true humor aren\\'t worth sitting through ninety-five minutes of lame drivel.\\nSON-IN-LAW is a singularly unexceptional comedy, the content of which is well-represented by the theater trailers and TV ads. It\\'s perfect fare for watching on cable, but not worth the time or effort of making a trip to a theater. Those who can\\'t stand Pauly Shore would do well to stay away, and those that love him will go regardless of what I say. So, for those who don\\'t care one way or another, be aware that SON-IN-LAW gives exactly what you expect: a dumb, predictable romantic comedy that has more animals than laughs.\\n',\n",
              " 'Featuring the voices of Michael Crawford, Ben Vereen, Ellen Blain, and Paige Gosney Director: Charles Grosvenor Producers: David Kirschner and Jerry Mills Screenplay: Mark Young and Kelly Ward Music: James Horner Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nA small group of forest critters goes on a quest to find herbs with which to heal their friend after the local village has been devastated as the result of a gas spill. This is the premise of the lackluster and very politically correct ONCE UPON A FOREST, the latest subpar G-rated animated feature to go after the money of parents in search of suitable entertainment for their young offspring.\\nWith its recent three animated features, Disney has proven that animation capable of entertaining adults (as well as children) is not dead. I enjoyed THE LITTLE MERMAID, was enthralled by BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and had a lot of fun watching ALADDIN. Other than those at Disney, however, the only person around today capable of achieving a high standard for animated features is Don Bluth, the driving force behind AN AMERICAN TAIL.\\nBut wait--don\\'t the ads for ONCE UPON A FOREST state that this film comes from \"the creator of AN AMERICAN TAIL\"? Yes, they do, but the man they\\'re referring to is David Kirschner, who served as executive producer for TAIL. Those going to this film expecting to see a Bluth-quality motion picture are in for a rude surprise, although it\\'s a mistake Twentieth Century Fox would like to see repeated over and over again.\\nThe story is pathetically thin, even by the limited standards of an average five-year-old. Children will enjoy this movie the way they do Saturday morning cartoons, finding it mildly entertaining but nothing special (does that make it worth an admission price?). Mercifully, the running time is short, so parents accompanying their children won\\'t be bored to death.\\nFor the most part, the animation isn\\'t worth mentioning. The characters move, but the background doesn\\'t, and there are only a few scenes where any real attention was paid to establishing some sort of mood (those include a venture into a construction site and an adventure involving a well-depicted owl).\\nRemember last year\\'s disappointing FERN GULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST? Well, ONCE UPON A FOREST shares many of that movie\\'s traits, right down to the \"don\\'t destroy nature\" theme. However, while FERN GULLY could at least claim the asset of Robin Williams\\' vocal talents, ONCE UPON A FOREST is stuck. It has Ben Vereen, but his voice is used for maybe two minutes worth of screen time.\\nThere\\'s not much else that I can say about ONCE UPON A FOREST. Lackluster productions like this aren\\'t worth additional words. The movie is dull and shows an obvious lack of innovation and creativity, but for those desperate to take their kids to a \"suitable\" movie, this one will fit the bill, although it might be better to wait a few weeks for the re-release of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES. If you go, however, remember this: it\\'s the adults, not the kids, who will have trouble sitting through the movie.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Mason Gamble, Walter Matthau, Joan Plowright, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Robert Stanton Director: Nick Castle Producers: John Hughes and Richard Vane Screenplay: John Hughes Music: Jerry Goldsmith Released by Warner Brothers Pictures\\nIn 1951, a comic strip character by the name of Dennis Mitchell made his debut. Inked by Hank Ketcham, it didn\\'t take long for DENNIS THE MENACE to become a favorite. During the course of the next forty-two years, Dennis would be turned into a weekly television series, an animated program, and now, a major motion picture.\\nAll the characters are present. There\\'s Dennis (Mason Gamble), the blond five-year old demon with a cowlick. Dennis\\' long-suffering mother Alice is capably played by Lea Thompson, and the venerable British actress Joan Plowright takes a turn as Mrs. Wilson. Perhaps the best bit of casting is the choice of Walter Matthau as Mr. Wilson, the grumpy neighbor who becomes the frequent target of Dennis\\' pranks.\\nThrown into the group, with no apparent value other than to provide a HOME ALONE-type villain, is Christopher Lloyd\\'s Switchblade Sam, a homeless thief who roams the neighborhood stealing purses and breaking into houses. Sam\\'s inclusion is perhaps the movie\\'s biggest mistake since it takes the focus away from the more interesting Dennis/Mr. Wilson interaction by introducing an uninspired plot line that ends up resembling a poor man\\'s hack job of O. Henry\\'s \"The Ransom of Red Chief\".\\nThere are too many \"HOME ALONEisms\" in DENNIS THE MENACE. We don\\'t need to see Mr. Wilson fall prey to many of the same sorts of \"accidents\" that previously tormented Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. At least in the two HOME ALONE movies, the victims were bad guys. Here, while Mr. Wilson isn\\'t the most affable of neighbors, he certainly isn\\'t a villain, and is undeserving of the cruel treatment dished out to him. On the other hand, Switchblade Sam is a crook, so the only thing wrong with his getting a thorough plastering is that this part of the story (a little kid beating up on an unsuspecting and stupid criminal) has lost its spontaneity and appeal. Through blatant overuse, it has gotten old real quick.\\nRecycling old formulas is, in fact, the big problem. Even setting aside the reuse of HOME ALONE material, there\\'s nothing original in this film. Certainly no one would claim anything to be distinctive about the \"buddy\" relationship that develops between Dennis and Mr. Wilson. Countless pictures have explored this theme, including the recent offerings COP AND AN HALF and LIFE WITH MIKEY. DENNIS THE MENACE has nothing to offer that those two didn\\'t, and that immediately puts it in pretty poor company.\\nIn general, I didn\\'t find DENNIS THE MENACE particularly funny, although the kids in the audience enjoyed it. There\\'s nothing repugnant about the film. Like HOME ALONE, it\\'s a live-action cartoon. There are a few worthwhile moments, the best of which may be the one that goes on side-by- side with the closing credits. Almost all the scenes featuring Dennis and Mr. Wilson are entertaining (although the occasional attempts at pathos are out of place). Unfortunately, these are too few. Time is taken away from developing this relationship to allow the inclusion of the inane Christopher Lloyd subplot.\\nPleasantly surprising is the likability of Mason Gamble\\'s Dennis. He isn\\'t the brat that the previews and ads portray him to be. Gamble\\'s cute performance becomes more endearing than obnoxious, combining the same mixture of innocence, enthusiasm, and vulnerability that made Macaulay Culkin a star. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Gamble\\'s child co- stars (Amy Sakasitz as Margaret and Kelly Hathaway as Joey). These two are so annoying that I was yearning for Dennis to plunk them both with slingshot-launched marbles.\\nSome concern has been expressed about the image that Christopher Lloyd\\'s character presents of a homeless person. I contend that rather than giving a negative impression of the homeless, with which he is never clearly associated, Switchblade Sam will instead reinforce a lesson that is taught to children every day: don\\'t talk to strangers. I don\\'t see Sam doing any more to affect opinions on the homeless than Brenda Fricker\\'s amiable bag lady did in HOME ALONE 2.\\nDENNIS THE MENACE is basically an innocuous movie. I think most children will get a kick out of it, and those adults roped into seeing it won\\'t find themselves yearning to escape through the nearest exit (as is unfortunately the case with too many \"family films\"). On the other hand, I wonder if DENNIS is worth the money. It isn\\'t that much better than a lot of the current fare on television, and won\\'t lose a whole lot in the translation from big screen to video. Basically, there\\'s nothing remarkable about this movie that demands for it to be seen. If you\\'re running low on films to take the family to, DENNIS THE MENACE will do. Otherwise, it might be prudent to spend the time (and money) on something of a little better quality.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: varies Running Length: 2:31 Rated: NR (Nudity, mature themes)\\nStarring: Karen-Lise Mynster, Erland Josephson, Ghita Norby, Torben Zeller, Jesper Christensen Director: Liv Ullmann Producer: Lars Kolvig Screenplay: Liv Ullmann and Peter Poulson from the novel MENDEL PHILIPSEN & SON by Henri Nathensen Music: various composers Released by Arrow Entertainment Danish with English Subtitles\\nThe year is 1886 and although twenty-eight-year old Sofie (Karen-Lise Mynster) has been of marriageable age for a decade, she has yet to find a suitable match. Her parents Semmy (Erland Josephson) and Frederikke (Ghita Norby) want their only child to choose a cultured, educated Jew, but Sofie is searching for love and passion. She longs for the same kind of rich, affectionate bonding that her parents share. When Sofie falls for the painter Hojby (Jesper Christensen), Semmy and Frederikke become alarmed at the prospect of their daughter marrying a Gentile and decide to take action, condoning a marriage with the mournful Jonas (Torben Zeller). Sofie at first rejects the match but, in the face of mounting pressure from her family, she finds herself torn between passion and duty, and forced to reconsider her original decision.\\nThose that see SOFIE will undoubtedly be struck by the similarities between this film and the work of Ingmar Bergman. Considering those involved in the project, this is not surprising. SOFIE marks the directorial debut of the internationally-recognized actress Liv Ullmann, who began working with Bergman in 1967\\'s HOUR OF THE WOLF. Also present is actor Erland Josephson, who worked on numerous Bergman efforts, including 1982\\'s much-lauded FANNY AND ALEXANDER.\\nNevertheless, although SOFIE is a Bergman kind of story with Bergman-like characters, Liv Ullmann lacks Bergman\\'s mastery. This is in no way a slight on her, since there are few--if any--directors today who could claim to be on such a high plane. For a debut, this is an ambitious, if not entirely successful, effort.\\nIt\\'s rare for any movie, whether domestic or foreign, to cast such a group of plain actors and actresses. Even though Sofie is repeatedly referred to as beautiful, Karen-Lise Mynster is far from ravishing (although to call her homely would be a stretch). The two male leads (Christensen and Zeller) are equally unremarkable. These casting choices, which in Hollywood would be considered disastrous, work because they give the audience a sense that the story unfolding is happening to real people.\\nThe greatest flaw of SOFIE lies in its uneven pacing and choppy narrative style. The first two hours go by too slowly, often spending excessive time on minor issues while glossing over more important ones (the reasons for Sofie\\'s choice of a husband are almost entirely ignored, and the psychological struggle accompanying this decision is largely omitted). However, in the final thirty minutes, time accelerates greatly, and events go by too fast. Numerous interesting events occur during the last quarter of the film, but the opportunity is not there to savor them.\\nAnother problem is the emotional distance between the audience and the characters. For whatever reason, Ullmann keeps Sofie at arm\\'s-length for most of the movie. Some of this is undoubtedly a byproduct of the pacing, but the script waits too long to express Sofie\\'s motivation and for much of the movie she seems to be a reactive--and rather dull--person. Additionally, while Ms. Mynster is a fine actress, she is significantly older than twenty-eight and, as a result, is somewhat difficult to accept during the early scenes when she portrays the young Sofie.\\nOne recurrent theme that is handled expertly is the inflexibility of time. Once a decision is made, it cannot be undone, and things put off until tomorrow often never get accomplished. In an especially poignant scene, Sofie reflects on how she will soon be a grandmother holding a child in her lap when it seems that just yesterday she was a child sitting in her grandmother\\'s lap. Moments like these, although perhaps too far apart in this movie, recall Bergman at his best.\\nTaken as a whole, SOFIE is an unhappy film, but some of what Ullmann has done with the story keeps it from being an unrelenting source of depression. The director shows that even in the most tragic of existences, there are moments of simple joy and triumph. Even as elements of Sofie\\'s life collapse around her, she finds things to cling to, most often her parents and her son. The simple, happy marriage of her mother and father presents a refreshing counterpoint to her own unhappy relationship with her husband.\\nBeyond the plodding pace of SOFIE, there\\'s a great deal of worthwhile material. Although the movie varies from dull to riveting, the acting is constant throughout. This is not a film for the \"average\" movie-goer, but for those who like character-driven stories that focus on the friction between generations, SOFIE is a worthy entry. It may lack many of the subtle touches of an Ingmar Bergman film, but it\\'s unmistakable at whose hands Liv Ullmann learned her newest trade.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: varies Running Length: 1:45 Rated: NR (Mature themes)\\nStarring: Daniel Auteuil, Emmanuelle Beart, Andre Dussollier, Elisabeth Bourgine Director: Claude Sautet Producers: Jean-Louis Livi and Philippe Carcassonne Screenplay: Yves Ulmann, Jacques Fieschi, and Jerome Tonnere Music: Maurice Ravel Released by October Films French with English Subtitles\\nStephane (Daniel Auteuil) and Maxime (Andre Dussollier) share a friendship the closeness of which is unusual between employee and employer. Stephane works for Maxime at an exclusive Paris violin repair shop. One evening, when the two are at dinner, Maxime announces that he has fallen in love with a new client, Camille Kessler (Emmanuelle Beart). The affair is so serious that Maxime has left his wife and intends to move in with Camille. Upon meeting his friend\\'s new lover, Stephane is immediately intrigued, and the reaction is certainly mutual. It doesn\\'t take long for the feelings between the two to grow, and their contact, while infrequent, becomes increasingly intimate. Yet even as Stephane fights to maintain his own emotional equilibrium, for the first time in her life, Camille loses hers, and her simple attraction to Stephane becomes an obsession.\\nOften foreign films, and French films in particular, are thought of by the average movie-goer as being exceptionally (and some would say \"overly\") intellectual. This could not be more true than for UN COEUR EN HIVER, yet it is not merely the mind that this film touches. The rich musical score (Ravel) is a feast for the ears, and the exceptional performances of the principals leads to several emotionally-potent moments. UN COEUR EN HIVER is one of those rare films that can be described as completely satisfying.\\nDistilled to its basic essence, the movie is a story that the French do so well: the romantic triangle. Beyond the premise, however, there is nothing ordinary about UN COEUR EN HIVER. From the point where Stephane and Camille meet, much of what happens goes contrary to expectations. Theirs is definitely not a typical tale of clandestine love. Rather, it is an examination of the prices of emotional honesty and emotional isolation.\\nOddly enough, it\\'s Stephane, the character with the most screen time (and the man whose heart is \"in winter\") who remains much the enigma to the audience. Even though we come to identify with him, and understand some of what he does, the depth of his emotions often remains unclear. The last scene of the movie explicitly reveals part of the truth, but for much about Stephane, the viewer must reach his or her own conclusions.\\nDaniel Auteuil plays his role with ability. His is a difficult performance to make succeed, given the ambiguity surrounding Stephane, but Auteuil has found the perfect balance. At times it becomes difficult to determine whether Stephane should be pitied or vilified, and it is to Auteuil\\'s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty.\\nCamille is no less a complicated character, but her feelings are simpler to read. She hides nothing, and when she recognizes that she loves Stephane, there is no doubt in her mind--or ours--of the truth. Especially noteworthy is the way that Camille\\'s sudden, intense passion for Stephane intertwines, and at times conflicts with her lifelong love of music.\\nEmmanuelle Beart gives an astonishing, unaffected performance. Emotion is often displayed in the most subtle and easy-to-miss gestures, expressions, and vocal inflections. Before beginning production of UN COEUR EN HIVER, Beart had never played the violin. After the film\\'s release in France, director Claude Sautet claimed that she \"fooled everyone\" with her \"perfect motions\" (violinist Jean-Jacques Kantorow does the actual playing). Not only are her hand movements accomplished, but the look of rapture on her face as she loses herself in the music of Ravel is a clear example of how fully Ms. Beart allowed the personae of Camille to enfold her.\\nBeart explained the importance of coming to understand music as integral to defining Camille: \"[Director] Claude [Sautet] told me from the beginning, \\'I will only ask one thing of you; play the violin. The day you can play the violin, you will be Camille. There is nothing more I can tell you about the character.\\'\" Indeed, it is the importance of music to Camille that puts every other emotion in the film, whether displayed by her or by others, into perspective.\\nUN COEUR EN HIVER is yet another case of real-life chemistry translating well to the screen. Beart and Auteuil are companions away from their acting, and the spark of this intensity, even unfulfilled as it is here, is too obvious to miss.\\nWith the exceptions of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and SOMMERSBY, there have been no 1993 releases to equal the power of UN COEUR EN HIVER. Strong characters, intelligent writing, and exquisite performances combine to draw the audience into the movie. Mental and emotional participation are demanded. This is a movie with deep, churning currents. Those who are attracted only to Hollywood\\'s shallow waters may find UN COEUR EN HIVER too intimidating, but anyone who enjoys a more complex cinematic experience will find as much as they could hope for in this picture.\\n',\n",
              " 'Eight-year old Jonah Baldwin (Ross Malinger) misses his mother, who died eighteen months ago from cancer. More than that, however, he recognizes that his father Sam (Tom Hanks) is desperately lonely. So, on Christmas Eve, Jonah calls up a radio talk-show psychologist and asks for help. Forced onto the phone by his son and identified as \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" Sam reluctantly (at first) opens up and talks about his love for his dead wife and the things that made her special. Across the country in Baltimore, Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) is listening to the syndicated program, and Sam\\'s testimonial of love brings tears to her eyes. Even though she is engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman), Annie begins to wonder what it would be like to meet Sam, even going so far as to be one of thousands to write a letter to him. But when circumstances conspire to make an assignation possible, the question is whether either Sam or Annie will have the courage to follow the signs that fate has shown to them.\\nThere are those who will claim that SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is too corny, with sugar-coated cuteness filling in for the lack of a strong plot. And, while they have a point, there\\'s something that the cynics are missing--it\\'s meant to be that way. By its own admission, this film is intended to be a throwback to the screen romances of the past (AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER in particular, which is cited numerous times, and borrowed from explicitly and implicitly). Anyone going to see SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE expecting a tale of stark modern life has walked into the wrong theater. This is a timeless, dreamy fantasy whose mood falls somewhere between magic and reality.\\nCoincidence is the backbone of Nora Ephron\\'s story, wending its way through the plot with uncanny repetitiveness. Skillfully, however, the script turns to its advantage what could have been a major hindrance to the audience\\'s suspension of disbelief. The concept of destiny is an important element to all that transpires. At the beginning of the film, Annie is a realist who dismisses the idea of a supernatural sign as nothing more than a random occurrence. By the end of SLEEPLESS, she has become a firm believer in fate. Considering the unusual nature of the bond she develops with Sam, how could she not?\\nWhile this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, especially amidst the burgeoning tide of action/adventure summer fare, it is not without flaws. The character of Walter, although nicely played by Bill Pullman, is superfluous. His inclusion is meant to say something about Annie\\'s life and personality but, as the movie progresses, he becomes more of a hindrance and annoyance than an asset. His purpose is never clearly delineated and the too-neat resolution of this subplot is lacking in believability.\\nThen there\\'s Annie\\'s family. The dinner scene with them near the beginning of the movie is pointless, with the attempts at humor coming across as weak and unfunny. Little of value is revealed about any character. Apparently what we\\'re supposed to learn is how quirky Annie\\'s relatives are and how this has impacted on her personality, but the way the scene is played, the result is only partially achieved. It\\'s not that this part of the movie is unpleasant, but it doesn\\'t seem to belong, and the cutting-room floor might have been a more appropriate place for it to reside.\\nThe ending is a little abrupt, but not in a bad sense. It\\'s usually a positive trait of a film to keep the audience hungry at the conclusion. We want to see a little more--perhaps just a crumb to nibble on--even though it\\'s clear that the story has reached its natural conclusion. More often than not, as is the case in SLEEPLESS, this is an indication that the characters have been well-defined and deftly portrayed.\\nTom Hanks, who is frequently chosen for parts that demand energy and verve, does an excellent job in a subdued role. It\\'s easy enough to make the widower into a cliche, but Mr. Hanks\\' heartfelt performance, combined with an intelligent script, have avoided that. Instead of a person lifted from stock, we are given a man we can accept and whose grief we can sympathize with.\\nMeg Ryan has a less challenging role and, compared to what she did in PRELUDE TO A KISS (where she had to play the old man in a young woman\\'s body), there\\'s nothing noteworthy about what she does. She\\'s a likable actress who is fine for the part, but she has far fewer \"moments\" than Mr. Hanks.\\nThe supporting actors are effective. Rosie O\\'Donnell and newcomer Ross Malinger manage to steal their share of scenes. Bill Pullman, despite being saddled with a poorly-developed character, manages to make an impression (sort of like in NEWSIES). Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks\\' real-life wife) have small parts.\\nSLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has been billed as a \"romantic comedy,\" but the accent is more on romance than humor. Comic moments are kept to a minimum, and there are only a couple of openly funny scenes (one involves a comparison of \"male\" and \"female\" movies--AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER versus THE DIRTY DOZEN). Subtle humor abounds, but it\\'s the kind that normal people encounter in everyday life, more often worthy of a chuckle than outright laughter.\\nAs an antidote to the summer doldrums and an alternative to dinosaurs, rock-climbing, and last action heroes, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is perfect. While lacking the unfettered charm and exuberance of Kenneth Branagh\\'s MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, this film is enjoyable in its own right, not to mention more easily accessible. Lovers will probably enjoy this a fraction better than singles, but there\\'s more than enough in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE to cause the edges of just about everyone\\'s lips to curl upwards.\\nOh, one more gripe. Brooks Robinson, while unquestionably a great baseball player, is not (as this film claims) the lone choice for best third baseman of all time. Of equal, if not greater, stature is a man by the name of Mike Schmidt.\\n',\n",

McDeere (Tom Cruise) has just graduated in the top five of his class from Harvard Law School. With a record like his, there are understandably a lot of people interested in employing him. Offers abound from the large, the prestigious, and the desirable, but eventually it\\'s a small firm from Memphis that snares Mitch\\'s services. Bendini, Lambert, and Locke make the terms of his joining them so enticing that the deal is impossible to turn down--a starting salary near $100,000, a low-interest mortgage so he can buy a house, free use of a Mercedes, and repayment of his college loans. At first, Mitch and his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) eagerly celebrate their new life and home, but it doesn\\'t take long for the euphoria to wear thin. Two members of the Firm die under suspicious circumstances and soon Mitch begins to wonder what secrets lie behind the locked doors of Bendini, Lambert, and Locke.\\nJohn Grisham\\'s novel THE FIRM is a furious page-turner, the kind of book that you don\\'t want to put down once you\\'ve started reading it. The characters are well-rounded and developed in such a way that the reader cares about their fates. The fascinating setup (roughly the first 100 pages) is perhaps the novel\\'s greatest strength and, even though the eventual resolution lacks punch, few would deny that THE FIRM is an entertaining read.\\nSydney Pollack\\'s film THE FIRM is the kind of movie that almost anyone could walk out on without feeling that they\\'ve missed much, regardless of whether they\\'ve read the book or not. Very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has made it to the screen and what we\\'re left with instead is an overly-long (two hours and thirty-four minutes, to be exact), pedantic thriller that, at best, can be described as average.\\nThe producer/director has been quoted as saying that he wants his movie to stand on its own, apart from the book. That\\'s a good idea, because the film THE FIRM doesn\\'t come close to reaching the level of intensity achieved by the novel of the same name. Comparisons are inevitable, of course, but it isn\\'t necessary to have read the written version to be disappointed by the visual adaptation.\\nThe plot is a good place to start the discussion. This was the book\\'s weakest element and, if anything, it\\'s worse in the movie. While the final \"twist\" to the movie\\'s story (which in no way resembles what happens in the novel) is clever, it is also difficult to accept. Let\\'s not forget the forces that Mitch is up against. Is it reasonable to believe everything that happens in the pivotal climactic scenes? I doubt it. While I applaud the screenwriters for coming up with a unique way to conclude the film, their inept execution of the concept causes the ending to seem cheap and contrived.\\nThe unfortunate tone of the movie is set during the first hour. The film spends quite a bit of time using short, often-disjointed scenes in an attempt to recapture the near-perfect mood of Grisham\\'s setup. This would have worked nicely if those various snippets had successfully conveyed the allure of the Firm to Mitch and Abby, but things rush by so quickly and everything is so out-of-sync that the result is to make the first quarter of the movie long and tedious.\\nThere are many differences between motion picture and novel. With numerous expected, mostly-minor cuts and changes, the first half of the film stays reasonably close to its written counterpart. After that, however, the differences become progressively larger until only the names of the characters and certain general events remain the same. Not all of the changes are bad--some, at least in their intent, are intriguing. Unfortunately, the script writers appear not to have thought things through all the way--a fault that Grisham\\'s novel is rarely guilty of.\\nOn the surface, Tom Cruise and Jeanne Tripplehorn might seem like acceptable choices to play the roles of Mitch and Abby McDeere. That is, until they start to \"act\". Cruise has at times been good in front of the camera (in pictures such as BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY), while in other instances he has done little more than show off his good looks (DAYS OF THUNDER). In the case of THE FIRM, which demands range and ability, the star falls solidly in the second category. Not until the last act does he give anything resembling a feeling performance, managing to effectively sabotage Mitch in the process. By the time things get interesting in THE FIRM, we don\\'t care what happens to the protagonist, because the actor playing him has failed to capture our sympathy.\\nJeanne Tripplehorn is worse, playing Abby with as much enthusiasm and energy as a zombie. Even as I was apathetic towards Mitch because of Cruise, I began to actively dislike Abby as a result of Tripplehorn\\'s unimaginative performance. Consider for a moment someone of Emma Thompson\\'s caliber in this part and you\\'ll want to break into tears of frustration.\\nFortunately for the film, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Especially worthy of mention are Ed Harris as FBI agent Tarrance and Wilford Brimley as De Vasher, the Firm\\'s security strong man. Both of these actors steal many of the scenes that they\\'re in.\\nAs impressive as these two, if not more so, is Gene Hackman\\'s Avery Tolar. Softened in the movie from his counterpart in the book, this Avery becomes the only completely real--and sympathetic--character in the film. Hackman\\'s performance is more than half the reason why. In the hands of a lesser actor, Avery could have become sappy, silly, or stupid, but not in this case. By the closing scenes of THE FIRM, he was the only one I really cared about.\\nI dislike bashing movies simply because they differ from the books that spawned them. The mediums of entertainment are different, after all, and should be treated as such. No film can do a perfect adaptation of a novel. In the case of THE FIRM, however, the problems have little to do with the changes made to the story. Putting aside the issue of its source, this is not a good movie. If there\\'s a reason to go, and I don\\'t think there is, it\\'s to see Gene Hackman\\'s performance. Unfortunately, given his amount of screen time, there\\'s a lot of other garbage that will have to be endured along the way.\\nIn the past, I\\'ve enjoyed many of Syndey Pollack\\'s projects (OUT OF AFRICA and TOOTSIE in particular), but this film got derailed early and even this talented director proved unable to get it back on course. I suppose it\\'s a difficult task to try to please both admirers of the novel and the casual movie-goer who has never read it. In attempting that, Pollack has made a mess of everything--plot, characterization, and pacing. Even the music, by Dave Grusin, is inappropriate.\\nFans of John Grisham\\'s novel will see THE FIRM regardless of what reviews it gets, so to them, and to others, I offer a cautionary warning to be wary. THE FIRM had a lot of potential but the production team found numerous ways to mess it up. This isn\\'t an awful film, nor is it unwatchable, but I\\'d think twice before spending time and money in a darkened theater with telling of Mitch McDeere\\'s struggles.\\n',\n",

Orlando (Tilda Swinton) is a young nobleman who has found favor with Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp). As a result of his relationship as the \"son\" of her old age, Orlando is granted the deed to a sizable piece of property. Ten years later, following the death of his father, Orlando falls in love with a beautiful Russian princess (Charlotte Valandrey). After that relationship ends in tragedy, and following a brief-but-disastrous flirtation with poetry, Orlando becomes an ambassador to central Asia. It is now the 18th century and Orlando has lived more than one-hundred years without showing a day\\'s aging. But the most remarkable event of his life--his sudden and unexpected transformation into a woman--is yet to come.\\nORLANDO is a movie thin on story but thick on elegance and style. Characters and settings, as well as a brief-but-lavish tour through 400 years of history, take precedence over plot. Even on its own terms, the storyline of this film is weak and riddled with contrivances, questions, and problems. Writer Sally Potter, adapting from Virginia Woolf\\'s novel, takes the approach that the narrative is essentially irrelevant. Its purpose is to allow explorations of Orlando as he/she develops over the years, and of the ever-changing attitudes of society.\\nThose that want a detailed examination of how a person copes with unusual longevity won\\'t find it here. In fact, other than a throw-away line by Queen Elizabeth (in which she bestows land upon Orlando under the condition that he not grow old and wrinkled like her), there is no explanation given for why the title character neither ages nor dies. This is taken as a given; one of the many plot points glossed over.\\nAnother thing that is more-or-less ignored is the mechanism by which Orlando changes sex. After a long sleep following a battle in which he refuses to kill, Orlando wakes up one morning as a woman. Her reaction is simple--\"Same person ... different sex\" and she evidences little or no surprise at the sudden and unexpected transformation.\\nLittle issue is made of how other characters react to Orlando\\'s femaleness. With the exception of Archduke Harry (John Wood), no one makes a big deal out of it, although the English courts remove Orlando\\'s property since a woman cannot legally inherit land. As one man comments when the Victorian courts can\\'t determine whether Orlando is dead or a woman, \"They\\'re pretty much the same thing.\"\\nOne constant source of interest in ORLANDO is watching how English society and customs change over the centuries. After Orlando\\'s transformation, it\\'s fascinating to watch the size of her gown as it shrinks from its mammoth proportions of the 1700s to the more \"natural\" garb of the present day. This is only a subtle indication of how women come to be regarded more as people than property.\\nOther than Orlando, there is no character that is around for more than about 15 or 20 minutes. Billy Zane, who plays the American adventurer Shelmerdine, shares billing with lead actress Tilda Swinton, but is on-screen for only a handful of scenes. The same is true of all the other co-stars.\\nSwinton gives a masterful performance, displaying amazing range as both a man and a woman. Even though her decidedly-feminine appearance hurts the audience\\'s ability to accept Orlando as a man, the manner in which Swinton speaks and acts during that part of the film are masculine. She is more believable after the transformation, but that\\'s mainly because her looks now match her mannerisms.\\nSharing the opposite-gender playing with Tilda Swinton is actor Quentin Crisp, who plays Queen Elizabeth I. There\\'s no difficulty accepting Crisp as the wrinkled old queen. Perhaps this, in addition to other recent males-playing-females, indicate that, given the right physical appearance, it\\'s easier to make up a man like a woman than the other way around.\\nThose that go to ORLANDO expecting a tightly-constructed plot will leave with deflated expectations. The power of this movie is far removed from any of the many contrivances centered around the emaciated storyline. See ORLANDO for its fabulous costumes, fascinating look at changing eras, and impressive performance by Tilda Swinton. Viewing this film for other reasons will almost certainly lead to a negative impression.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: varies Running Length: 2:00 Rated: NR (Sex, nudity, violence, mature themes)\\nStarring: Misa Shimizu, Takehiro Murata, Takeo Nakahara Director: Takehiro Nakajima Producer: Takehiro Nakajima Screenplay: Takehiro Nakajima Music: Hiroshi Ariyoshi Released by Cinevista Japanese with English Subtitles\\n\"Okoge\" is a Japanese word that describes the crust of burned rice left in the bottom of a rice cooker. In recent years, it has also come to be used as a pejorative term for a woman who likes to hang around with gay men. In Takehiro Nakajima\\'s film OKOGE, Sayoko (Misa Shimizu) is such a person. She is obviously both curious about the gay lifestyle and free of the homophobic sentiments which permeate Japanese society. She meets Goh (Takehiro Murata) and his older lover Tochi (Takeo Nakahara) at a gay beach and is so touched by their open affection that she seeks out the pair and offers the use of her apartment when they can\\'t find a place to go to be alone. It isn\\'t long before a close friendship develops among the trio, and Sayoko becomes as much involved in the lives of Goh and Tochi as they do in hers.\\nFirst and foremost, OKOGE is an examination of the difficulties faced by gay men in a society as conservative and restrictive as that in Japan. Actually, many of the themes of the movie, as well as the problems encountered by the main characters, have universal implications. Switch things around a little and this tale could easily occur in the United States. Perhaps it takes a film from a different country to bring into perspective one of America\\'s more ugly hypocrisies: the supposedly \"free and open\" society run by people with closed minds.\\nToo often, one of the problems with movies involving homosexual themes and issues is a tendency to sermonize. Both THE LIVING END and CLAIRE OF THE MOON were guilty of this. Instead of letting the characters and story bring the message to the fore, each of those films felt it necessary to preach about the evils of a homophobic society. For the most part, OKOGE avoids this pitfall. There are a few scenes that are too obviously scripted (such as one in which a bunch of gay men sit around debating whether their sexual preference is the result of genetics or environment), but the movie generally allows the natural flow of its plot to explore issues, rather than relying on unconvincing contrivances.\\nOKOGE also has a sense of humor. Not a deadly-serious movie, this is instead a picture that is unafraid to let the audience laugh. Most of the jokes are at the expense of the homophobes in the film, and they are crafted skillfully enough to get the point across--and be funny--without becoming condescending.\\nNevertheless, all is far-from-perfect with OKOGE. Instead of being a cohesive whole, it\\'s more like two films, each very different in quality and tone from the other. The only constant is the characters.\\nThe first seventy-five minutes of OKOGE is a skillfully-done character study, focusing on the unusual menage a trois that exists between Sayoko, Goh, and Tochi. All three characters are skillfully-realized and well-developed, and the situations they find themselves in are believable. Then something happens to break one side of the triangle.\\nFrom that moment on, OKOGE is never the same. It begins to wander aimlessly, stumbling along as if unsure exactly where it wants to go. Sayoko has an affair with a soldier, the reasons for which are left murky and uncertain. Goh tries a heterosexual experiment that ends in disaster, and Tochi disappears altogether for a while. There is a sudden jump of about two years\\' time (which is left completely unexplained by the movie--it takes about thirty seconds to figure out what has happened), and everyone\\'s circumstances have changed. The film takes its last twenty minutes to resolve the various messes that the main trio have gotten themselves into.\\nAlthough a little on the sweet side, the ending is nicely-done, showing that love and sex don\\'t have to be two sides to the same coin, but there\\'s nearly forty minutes of confusion between the excellent beginning of OKOGE and its conclusion.\\nI\\'ve never before seen Japanese actress Misa Shimizu, but her performance in this film is an eye-opener. She puts an incredible amount of energy into her performance. I\\'m not sure how the character was written, but Shimizu\\'s rendering of Sayoko positively sparkles. The two male leads aren\\'t quite as good, but neither Murata nor Nakahara does a bad job.\\nOKOGE may not be an ideal movie, but it goes a long way towards removing the bad taste left behind by such heavy-handed efforts as THE LIVING END and CLAIRE OF THE MOON. Not only does it give an intelligent, sympathetic portrayal of the difficulties of a gay lifestyle, but it presents them from a woman\\'s point-of-view. Credit should be given to Takehiro Nakajima for daring to make this film in a country with such a rigid social structure. The strengths of OKOGE certainly outweigh the weaknesses.\\n',\n",
              " 'Henry Rowengartner (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a poor Little League player who can throw strikes (not very hard), but has trouble catching the ball. Then one day, while trying to impress a girl at school, he has an accident trying to prove that he doesn\\'t drop every fly that comes his way. His arm ends up in a cast for most of the summer, but when the doctor finally takes it off, Henry discovers a remarkable thing. Because of \"tight tendons\" in his right arm, he can somehow throw a ball in excess of 100 miles per hour. It doesn\\'t take long for the Cubs to give the twelve-year-old a tryout, then sign him up (how desperate is this team?) It\\'s a move that pays off because, after a rocky debut, Henry becomes the catalyst that leads the team into a Pennant Race.\\nBefore I do the written equivalent of tearing this film into shreds and dumping the remains where they belong, I\\'ll be honest enough to admit that boys around the age of ten seemed to enjoy ROOKIE OF THE YEAR very much. The movie is clean enough to be considered a family film, although I doubt many of the bored girls and disinterested parents in the audience would endorse it. Personally, I think that family films should be enjoyable for everyone in the family, not just a select sex/age group. There are movies available that meet this criteria (ALADDIN, THE SANDLOT, and A FAR OFF PLACE, to name a few). Unfortunately, their number is dwindling as they are replaced with dim-witted, poorly-conceived dross like this picture.\\nAs the title suggests, ROOKIE OF THE YEAR aspires to be a baseball movie. In this, it fails in almost every respect. Fans of the game will be horrified by the lack of attention paid to the nuances and subtleties of baseball, while those who don\\'t like \"America\\'s pastime\" will probably find this film uninspiring, unimaginative, and uninteresting (all of which it certainly is).\\nA gargantuan misstep is that ROOKIE OF THE YEAR tries a few stabs at drama while its outrageous setup allows only for the most absurd of comedies. Maybe the Monty Python troupe could have done something with the premise, but it\\'s way beyond Daniel Stern\\'s meager abilities. As an actor, Stern has a flair for comedy (as showcased in HOME ALONE and CITY SLICKERS), but as a director (at least from the evidence we\\'re given here), he is inept. Unfortunately, as far as this movie is concerned, Daniel the actor doesn\\'t do much better than Daniel the director. His character, that of a wacky pitching coached who got beaned once too often, is easily the most potentially-amusing member of the Cubs, but Stern tries too hard for laughs and ends up getting little more than grimaces.\\nThis movie is bad even as a fantasy for Cubs lovers and Mets haters. There\\'s not enough substance here to give meaning to the \"big game\" between the two clubs. Added to that, the Mets are portrayed as such a ridiculously over-the-top gang of thugs and losers that it\\'s impossible to hate them. Besides, given the team\\'s current woeful brand of real baseball, setting this team up as the heavy is a huge mistake. No one despises New York\\'s National League team any more (except perhaps their own fans)--they\\'re too woeful for that.\\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR presents a perfect opportunity for a line of cameos by current and ex-Major League players. However, with the exception of fleeting glances of Bobby Bonilla, Pedro Guererro, and Barry Bonds (in a Pirates uniform--oops), there\\'s nothing. No members of the real Cubs are around, and play-by-play announcer Harry Carry is conspicuous by his absence. Personally, I can\\'t stand the man, but in a film so indulgent of Wrigley Field fantasies, the omission of Carry is profoundly felt. Instead, all we get is an embarrassingly silly John Candy doing his best Harry imitation--and a pale one it is, at that.\\nThis is a genuinely insulting movie. It takes every formula and cliche and binds them together into a package that doesn\\'t work. Things might have been better if the director and screenwriter had shown a hint of aptitude, but nothing like that is forthcoming. Most baseball films, even the best of them, are formula-driven. Robert Redford hitting a home run in the bottom of the ninth is pure fantasy, not to mention absolutely predictable, but it\\'s still a great movie moment. ROOKIE OF THE YEAR lacks this kind of style, and its comedy is so daft that it can\\'t compete with the likes of MAJOR LEAGUE (which was, at best, a mediocre film).\\nOf course, the characters are stock, and the actors aren\\'t able to do anything with them. Amy Morton, playing Henry\\'s mom, overacts outrageously. Thomas Ian Nicholas, in the title role, manages to make his character as annoying and unpleasant as possible. I\\'m sure I\\'m not the only one who wished someone would plunk that kid when he was dancing off first base and making fun of the Dodgers\\' pitcher.\\nOutperforming every one is Gary Busey, but his is a thankless job. He puts an effort into bringing to the surface several facets of what is essentially a two-dimensional character, but there\\'s not much that Busey can do to save Chet Steadman. However, a purpose served by the presence of Busey is to give a yardstick by which the lackluster performances of the rest of the cast can be measured. Opposite him, none of them look good.\\nIf you\\'re a ten-year-old boy who wants to vicariously live out the fantasy of playing for a big-league ball club, this might be a movie worth seeing, but for anyone else, it represents a blunder as big as a hanging curve ball. In baseball, you get three strikes and you\\'re out, but in the making of ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, Daniel Stern has gotten far more than that. Nearly the only good thing about this film is that I saw it in an air-conditioned theater on a day when the thermometer had nudged above the 100 degree mark. Nevertheless, half-way through the movie, the heat outside was starting to look good.\\n',\n",
              " 'Dead man seen dancing in a Congo line, picking up date for the rest of the night, and fighting with her overmuscled boyfriend. Film at eleven.\\nThe original WEEKEND AT BERNIE\\'S is an incredibly stupid film with enough off-color, macabre physical comedy to generate some laughs. It\\'s a perfect VCR film--little or no attention is required to the plot, you can walk out of the room and come back in without missing anything, and the reduction of the picture to television size does nothing to hurt the film. It\\'s not intuitive to expect a sequel to this brainless movie, but the original WEEKEND did surprisingly well at the box-office. Add to that the results from a big video market and a second installment became in inevitability.\\nPart two, helmed by Robert Klane, the man behind the previous effort, starts off basically where part one ends. Bernie (Terry Kiser), murdered in the original film, is now in the morgue. The two idiots (Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman) who dragged his body around through the original discover the key to a safety deposit box in his personal effects. This starts them on a treasure hunt for the missing two million dollars that Bernie embezzled from the company. Also along for the ride is Hummel (Barry Bostwick), the company\\'s sneering head-of-security, who needs to find the money to save his job. Then there\\'s a third group, working for some unnamed criminals, and using voodoo to animate Bernie\\'s dead corpse so that it will lead them to the cash.\\nLike HOME ALONE 2, WEEKEND AT BERNIE\\'S 2 is pretty much a re-hash of the first movie. You get just about what you expect--two morons dragging around a dead body (that they use deodorant to \"freshen up\") that everyone mistakes as being alive. There\\'s a girl who spends a night on the beach with Bernie (no sex--not even this movie is that off-color) and claims it was the most enjoyable time she\\'s had in a while. Of course, the corpse also gets viciously abused in every manner possible, without ever showing a scratch. In addition to repeats of what happened in WEEKEND 1, the body gets stuffed in a suitcase, jammed into a refrigerator, and shot through the head with an arrow.\\nIn this movie, the body can move, thanks to a voodoo ceremony involving a pigeon (replacing a chicken that ran away--smart move on the chicken\\'s part). We\\'re treated to numerous scenes in which a herky-jerky Bernie dances to whatever tune is playing nearby. However, when the music stops, the body collapses like a marionette with its strings cut.\\nAs was true in WEEKEND 1, the best performance is turned in by Terry Kiser as the corpse. That certainly isn\\'t an endorsement of the abilities of the rest of the cast, but it\\'s a true statement. Kiser\\'s sense for physical comedy is good, and he manages to infuse this otherwise worthless movie with enough energy to keep it out of the bottom rung of 1993 films.\\nWEEKEND AT BERNIE\\'S 2 is made for a certain audience--the indiscriminate movie-goer who will see almost anything that guarantees a few laughs. Those that belong to that group will find what they\\'re looking for in this film. Almost all the humor is macabre and repetitive, but the film manages to be sporadically funny. Nevertheless, I find it hard to believe that many people will pay $6 or $7 to see a picture that has TV sitcom production values, writing, and acting.\\nFor those who like movies in which corpses get knocked around and banged up, yet still manage to be more engaging than the living people around them, this film will not disappoint. Also, fans of the original WEEKEND AT BERNIE\\'S will probably be satisfied by this latest (and hopefully last) installment. Everyone else, especially those who restrict their film diet to \"good\" movies, should stay away (not that many of them would have considered going in the first place).\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: varies Running Length: 1:40 Rated: NR (Nothing offensive)\\nStarring: Anders Danielson Lie, Frank Robert, Elisabeth Sand, Bjorn Floberg Director: Erik Gustavson Producer: Petter J. Borgli Screenplay: Lars Saabye Christensen Music: Randall Meyers Released by RKO Pictures Norwegian with English Subtitles\\nHerman (Anders Danielson Lie) is not that much different from most 11-year old boys, but he\\'s unusual enough to earn him the taunts of his classmates and the scorn of his teachers. Counterbalancing his difficulties at school, however, is a warm home life. His parents (Elisabeth Sand and Bjorn Floberg) are both caring people who always make time in their busy lives for their son. Herman\\'s grandfather (Frank Robert), an aging man with a kind heart and an engaging disposition, becomes to his grandson more of a friend than a relative. However, Herman\\'s life is about to take a turn for the worse. After visiting the barber one day, he discovers that he has alopecia areata, a skin disease that, while not fatal or dangerous, will cause him to lose all of his hair.\\nHERMAN is a lugubrious film about a relatively uninteresting subject: the tribulations of a young boy who is going bald. Admittedly, with a script infused with lively wit or emotionally- wrenching pathos, it is possible to make a coming-of-age story entertaining. HERMAN, however, takes neither of these roads, instead opting for a relatively-straightforward telling of the tale. The instances of humor, while occasionally amusing, are easily telegraphed, and there\\'s very little in the film to form an emotional link between the title character and the audience.\\nGoing bald is likely to be a traumatic event for someone just out of his first decade of life, but the lack of any palpable threat to Herman\\'s health makes it difficult to feel for him. He becomes so morose and despondent about losing his hair that we begin to view him more as a whiner than someone undergoing a difficult time. At least at first, Herman definitely does not confront his disease heroically.\\nThe film really doesn\\'t go anywhere. Often, it\\'s difficult to gain an understanding of what HERMAN\\'s real goal is. Overall, I suppose it\\'s trying to give us a picture of a young boy who isn\\'t afraid to be unusual, and who eventually overcomes his problems through that sense of individuality, but it\\'s a message that takes too long to get across. This is not an involving movie. It\\'s not bad--there are enough quirks of character to assure that--but neither is it good.\\nFor those who like straightforward villains, a few of the kids in Herman\\'s class fit the bill nicely. They do all the things that bullies do to smaller children--make fun of them, intimidate them, and steal their things. Only one fellow classmate, a lively redheaded girl named Ruby, shows any friendship for Herman. In the end, she plays a part in his \"salvation,\" while all the bad kids are punished. This whole part of the story is fairly trivial.\\nAlthough HERMAN attempts to be another MY LIFE AS A DOG, it doesn\\'t come close. That film had an emotional impact. We were drawn into the on-screen lives of the characters. HERMAN keeps us too much at a distance. There are a few moments of genuine insight, but nothing lasting. In the end, instead of an emotionally-vibrant motion picture experience, this movie turns out to be something of a dud.\\n',\n",
              " 'In 1963, Frank Horrigan was among the \"best and brightest\" of the Secret Service, the personal choice of President Kennedy. On November 22 in Dallas, an afternoon that Horrigan will never forget, he became one of the few living agents to lose a president. Now, decades later and only months before a presidential election (perhaps 1992 or 1996--we\\'re never told exactly), Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) is stalking the President. Believing there to be an intangible bond between himself and Horrigan (he says they were both betrayed by a government they had once loved), Leary makes contact with the Secret Service agent to discuss his intentions. After his contact with the potential killer, Horrigan acts quickly to get himself posted to protection duty. This time, he has no intention of failing and believes that, given the opportunity, he will take the bullet. But Leary has everything on his side--time, opportunity, and a group of pig-headed behind-the-scenes men at the White House who refuse to alter the President\\'s itinerary no matter how grave the apparent danger is. And, as the election draws closer, Horrigan\\'s chances of averting a second tragedy seem progressively less likely.\\nJohn Malkovich may be one of the big screen\\'s most overlooked actors. Or, at least he was until this performance. It isn\\'t that he\\'s never done good work before--his version of Lenny in Gary Sinese\\'s OF MICE AND MEN was one reason for that film\\'s place in my top ten for last year--but most of the time he hasn\\'t been recognized for it. However, like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, now that Malkovich has been given a highly visible role in a significant movie, people will hopefully begin to rave about him. The job he does in IN THE LINE OF FIRE is certainly worthy of praise. Hands down, Malkovich\\'s assassin is the best thing about this excellent thriller--a villain that rivals Hannibal Lecter for intelligence and cold, calculated viciousness.\\nRene Russo gives her strongest performance to date. In truth, she\\'s little more than the \"window dressing\" that Frank Horrigan suggests is the role of female Secret Service agents, but she manages to do a lot with a thankless part. She has quite a bit of screen exposure, but not much meat to sink her teeth into. But, even playing second fiddle to Malkovich and one of Hollywood\\'s most popular leading men, she gets noticed.\\nEastwood is Eastwood, albeit a more vulnerable version akin to what we saw in UNFORGIVEN. He\\'s still tough, and he still isn\\'t afraid to use his gun, but Frank Horrigan is a man haunted by his past. He\\'s no longer sure whether it was simple indecision or an unwillingness to take a bullet that led to his not being there for Kennedy, and the possibility of the same situation arising a second time troubles him day and night. Horrigan gives us the human side of Eastwood--the side that we never get in a Dirty Harry film, the side that isn\\'t afraid to shed a tear.\\nDirector Wolfgang Petersen, best known for DAS BOOT, but also at the helm for the taut, twisted SHATTERED, is aware of what\\'s necessary to make a good thriller work. He knows the importance of pacing, and plays the tension in IN THE LINE OF FIRE like a virtuoso. Petersen takes what could have been a muddled motion picture and structures it perfectly, creating a superlative piece of entertainment. It helps, of course, that he has a strong cast.\\nPlot-wise, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is nothing extraordinary. It\\'s basically a formula-type thriller with one or two twists thrown in to keep the view off-balance. However, strength of character, coupled with a consistently high level of excitement, makes this film anything but ordinary. The most intriguing element of IN THE LINE OF FIRE is the cat-and-mouse game between Horrigan and Leary. The relationship of these two characters to each other is fascinating, as it explores psychological layers which many motion pictures find too difficult to convey realistically.\\nFor an example of how badly this sort of story (protecting a public figure from a dangerous assassin) can be botched, take a look at last year\\'s THE BODYGUARD. While there are similarities in the underlying plot structures of the two movies, development and execution are radically different. IN THE LINE OF FIRE is an intelligent motion picture; THE BODYGUARD represents mindless entertainment.\\nIt\\'s interesting how some of the most simple special effects can be the most effective. Video manipulation shows a few clips that appear to have Horrigan right in the midst of JFK\\'s Dallas entourage. The editing is done exceptionally well; it isn\\'t easy to tell that Eastwood wasn\\'t behind the President and First Lady. If nothing else, these scenes justify one of the themes of Michael Crichton\\'s novel RISING SUN--that video images can no longer be trusted to represent the truth.\\nA couple of negatives about IN THE LINE OF FIRE come to mind. First, while the music by Ennio Morricone is effective at times, there is at least one incident--during a rooftop chase--when it sounds like a regurgitation of something from THE UNTOUCHABLES. I know that many composers (including Morricone) have certain \"signature\" tunes, but this reuse of something he\\'s done in the past is a little too blatant for my liking.\\nSecondly, Eastwood\\'s Horrigan has one-too-many leaps of intuition during the climactic scenes. The overt nature of this plot device is neatly camouflaged by the ever-growing tension of the sequence, but it becomes apparent upon reflection. After all, we\\'re dealing with Frank Horrigan, grizzled veteran of the Secret Service, not Sherlock Holmes. There\\'s nothing earlier in the film that would lead us to believe that he possesses such powers of deduction.\\nOverall, however, this is a fine film, and certainly one of the most intelligent thrillers of the summer. IN THE LINE OF FIRE doesn\\'t require the special effects bonanza of JURASSIC PARK to involve the audience, nor does it rely on the mega-budget explosions and mountaintop battles of CLIFFHANGER. Compared to THE FIRM, a movie that some have identified as a picture of similar appeal and temperament, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is far better paced and scripted. So, for a couple of hours of entertainment, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is one of those rare \"big\" movies that doesn\\'t disappoint.\\n',\n",
              " \"Date Released: 7/23/93 Running Length: 1:48 Rated: PG-13 (Language, mature themes, violence)\\nStarring: Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Rosie O'Donnell, Cathy Moriarty, Dennis Farina, Marcia Strassman Director: John Badham Producers: Jim Kouf, Cathleen Summers, Lynn Bigelow Screenplay: Jim Kouf Music: Arthur B. Rubinstein Released by Touchstone Pictures\\nThe original STAKEOUT, directed by John Badham, came out in 1987, and was one of my favorite movies of the year. It was a film that skillfully blended its mixture of action and comedy into an entertaining whole. The chemistry between the three leads--Richard Dreyfuss' Chris, Emilio Estevez' Bill, and Madeleine Stowe's Maria--was as good as it comes in movies. STAKEOUT ended up being more than just another cop/buddy film.\\nNow, six years later, John Badham is back along with Dreyfuss and Estevez (and the entire production team, including the writer, Jim Kouf, and the score composer, Arthur B. Rubinstein). The relationship between Chris and Bill hasn't changed much over six years, and neither has the mingling of action and humor. This time, Chris and Bill, along with Rosie O'Donnell's assistant DA, are looking for a witness on the run who's going to testify against the mob. Posing as a family, they move into a house next to the couple with whom contact may or may not be initiated. Another stakeout is under way.\\nWhen I first received the credit list for this movie, I skimmed through it to see who from the original would be returning. Much to my chagrin, Madeleine Stowe's name did not appear. This, in my opinion, was a huge mistake. While Estevez and Dreyfuss worked well together, it was the inclusion of Maria's character that lent an extra spark to the movie. It was hard to imagine how a STAKEOUT movie could function well without her.\\nFortunately, however, Stowe's Maria is present in ANOTHER STAKEOUT, albeit in an uncredited performance. It's more than a cameo, however. She's in four scenes and has more screen time than at least two of the actors whose names appear in the opening credits (Dan Lauria and Sharon Maughan). And yes, her scenes with Dreyfuss are still as well-played as ever. She may not have a major role in this installment, but her inclusion is an especially nice tip of the cap to continuity and what made the original movie effective. Now, on to what makes this film work.\\nIf done together well, comedy and action can make an excellent pairing. This has been proven many times, most notably in LETHAL WEAPON and the original STAKEOUT. It is evident here. If anything, this movie leans more towards outright humor than the first, and the action is consequently toned down. More importantly, ANOTHER STAKEOUT doesn't try to copy the first. The scenario is entirely different, as are the gags and the tempo.\\nThe inclusion of Rosie O'Donnell, comedienne-turned-actress, is a brilliant move. Without her presence, this movie wouldn't have worked nearly as well. She forms a quick rapport with Bill and Chris (of the love/hate variety), and the movie is off and running. O'Donnell is rapidly making an name for herself, and with good reason. Unlike Rita Rudner, another veteran of the stand-up routine who is venturing into movies, O'Donnell can act.\\nDreyfuss is as solid as ever, and seems to genuinely enjoy playing Chris. He steals a fair number of scenes, but that's true of almost any movie that he has a part in. Emilio Estevez, never one of my favorite actors, does a decent job. He's much better in the scenes he shares with Dreyfuss than those he has to carry on his own. Of course, that's not a big surprise.\\nMiguel Ferrer is not as charismatic or successful a villain as Aidan Quinn (whose performance as Maria's escaped convict ex-boyfriend galvanized STAKEOUT), but he's good enough for the purposes of this movie. Dan Lauria is on hand again, reprising his role, although in the interim spanning the two films, his character has gotten promoted to chief, and he's just itching to find some way to stick it to his two least-favorite detectives.\\nANOTHER STAKEOUT is tremendous fun. There's a lot of highly amusing (bordering on hilarious) humor, and the action scenes are handled with an eye for pacing and tension. If people find this gem in the midst of so many bigger name motion pictures, this is likely to be a huge crowd- pleaser. Because of the uncertainty of whether it will be noticed, I question the wisdom of releasing ANOTHER STAKEOUT at this time. Perhaps, like FOR LOVE OR MONEY, it should have been put off to the autumn.\\nIn general, I don't think the second STAKEOUT is as good as the first, but it is a worthy successor. Since virtually everyone involved in the 1987 picture is back for this one, the sense of continuity is seamless, both in big and little things. More importantly, because it actually has an entertaining story to tell, this is not one of the ever-growing number of sequels that should never have been made. Fans of the original movie will almost certainly be happy with ANOTHER STAKEOUT, and those that didn't see it won't be lost. This movie is well worth a look. It's one of the summer's best at providing unfettered enjoyment.\\n\",\n",

Three hundred years later, a skeptic by the name of Max (Omri Katz) ventures into the ruins of the witches\\' house, daring the supernatural to manifest itself. Heedless of warnings of his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and schoolmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max lights the dreaded Candle of Black Flame. Suddenly, the three Sanderson sisters have a second lease on life, and this time they don\\'t intend to waste it. Now it\\'s up to Max, with the help of Dani, Allison, and a talking black cat, to correct his error and stop them before it\\'s too late.\\nLike so many films that mix genres, in trying to do too much, HOCUS POCUS succeeds in very little. The comedy is sporadic and not often tremendously funny, the horror won\\'t frighten anyone over 8, and the adventure is dull and routine. As a family film, HOCUS POCUS is passable--you can take the kids to it and they\\'ll probably have a good time--but there doesn\\'t seem to be any great advantage in venturing into a theater to see this movie. It\\'s unremarkable enough that it won\\'t lose much on video.\\nIt seems that the root of HOCUS POCUS\\' weaknesses lies in its inability to develop believable characters. In the absence of nonstop, uproarious comedy or pulse-pounding action, strong characters are needed. What we get, however, are a number of poorly-written creations that are taken from the writers\\' stock of readily-available personalities. For the most part, the scenes that are intended to set up relationships are laughably absurd and difficult to accept.\\nPoor acting comes into play. Omri Katz is a bad choice for the hero of this piece. Actually, \"hero\" might not be the right word for his role--Max is so stupid and annoying at times that we wish the witches would stick him in their kettle and boil him alive. He treats his little sister like a burden (which is not entirely unrealistic for someone his age) and does some of the most amazingly stupid things. Everything that happens in HOCUS POCUS is essentially his fault.\\nThe normally-steady Bette Midler has some fun chewing on the scenery in a part that is played as intended: over-the-top. Clearly in Ms. Midler\\'s shadow, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy give such muted performances as to be virtually invisible. They do a lot of Three Stooges\\' physical gags, but without having mastered timing.\\nGenerally, HOCUS POCUS lacks energy. The direction by Kenny Ortega (who began his career as a choreographer) is flat, and the camerawork workmanlike (this is surprising considering that the cinematographer is Hiro Narita). The audience\\'s basic disconnection with the characters is part of the problem, but that\\'s not all of it. HOCUS POCUS is not a lot of fun. The film basically amounts to a great deal of pointless running around. The inventiveness that we keep expecting never materializes and by the end we\\'re still wondering if and when something\\'s going to happen to either galvanize us or cause us to double over with laughter.\\nThe previews for this film give a good indication of the movie\\'s overall quality--it\\'s like a live-action \"Broom Hilda.\" The best part of the movie--a couple of cameos by brother and sister Gary and Penny Marshall--are also highlighted by HOCUS POCUS\\' theatrical trailers, so they aren\\'t much of a surprise when they happen.\\nThere are a few special effects in HOCUS POCUS, but nothing new or ground-breaking. The walking corpse isn\\'t a masterpiece of design, but it\\'s done well--neither too real to be genuinely frightening nor too fake to be laughable. The parts of the film with the zombie try too hard to be campy, the results of which are less-than-successful. For fun at the expense of the dead, see Sam Raimi\\'s latest directorial venture, ARMY OF DARKNESS.\\nAt any rate, HOCUS POCUS is an occasionally dull, mostly pedantic motion picture with little to recommend it. It belongs on the long list of summer movies that will quickly be buried and forgotten until it surfaces on video in another six months. Frankly, that\\'s the fate it deserves. It isn\\'t putrid but, for my money, there are quite a few other films I\\'d see before this one. HOCUS POCUS never lives up to what little potential the premise has.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Jason James Richter, Lori Petty, Michael Madsen, Jayne Atkinson, Michael Ironside Director: Simon Wincer Producers: Jennie Lew Tugend and Lauren Shuler-Donner Screenplay: Keith A. Walker and Corey Blechman Music: Basil Poledouris Released by Warner Brothers\\nTraditionally, Man\\'s (or Woman\\'s) best friend is considered to be his (or her) dog. Sometimes, even a cat. But rarely is the love and affection of a boy won over by a killer whale. Such is the case in FREE WILLY, however, where young Jesse\\'s unusual relationship with an orca leads to his own redemption.\\nAbandoned by his mother when he was little, Jesse (Jason James Richter) has lived most of his life on the streets or in what is euphemistically called a \"childrens\\' home.\" After Jesse is caught spraypainting graffiti all over the observation windows to Willy the whale\\'s holding tank, his probation is to return to the scene of the crime by day and clean up the mess he made. Along the way, Jesse strikes up an unusual friendship with Willy and manages to get closer to the whale than Rae Lindley (Lori Petty), the trainer. Meanwhile, Jesse has been \"rescued\" from the home by Annie and Glen Greenwood (Michael Madsen), a couple looking for a young boy to share their home. Even though Annie and Glen seem like nice people, Jesse isn\\'t sure it\\'s a good situation for him, especially since he regards the rules of the house as little more than a thinly-veiled attempt to curtail his freedom.\\nBack in the late seventies, Dino DeLaurentis, the master of overbudgeted, poorly-written films, came out with a movie called ORCA: THE KILLER WHALE. Starring Richard Harris and Charlotte Rampling, and clearly designed as a rip-off of JAWS, this movie presented whales in the most negative light possible. They were beasts who lived to hunt, and man made a suitable prey. Now, approximately fifteen years later, we have been given this movie, one that presents the orca in a more reasonable--and believable--light.\\nFREE WILLY is not a great film--it relies on entirely too many cliches and formulas for that to be true. In fact, there won\\'t be many people going into the theater not knowing exactly how the movie is going to end (take a look at a TV commercial, theatrical trailer, or even the newspaper print ad). Despite that, FREE WILLY is a solid source of family entertainment, and a good reason to take the kids to the movies. This is one of those too-rare films that is capable of enthralling those under and over the age of twelve. There\\'s a little bit in FREE WILLY for people of all age groups.\\nFormula motion pictures, if done well, can be entertaining. Sure, you know what\\'s going to happen, but with good acting, direction, and photography, not to mention a few believable characters and some intelligent dialogue, it can still be fun travelling that oft-trodden road to the expected resolution.\\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR and HOCUS POCUS are examples of this summer\\'s family fare that fall on their faces. FREE WILLY avoids the traps that ensnare these movies, keeping clear of the mind-numbing idiocy of ROOKIE and the boredom of HOCUS POCUS. Instead, this film weaves a simple-yet-effective tale about a boy and his whale. It\\'s almost like Lassie or Old Yeller in water.\\nThis is the second venture into family movies for executive producer Richard Donner (of SUPERMAN and LETHAL WEAPON fame). His previous effort, which he directed, was a little-known and muddled fantasy about abused children. Called RADIO FLYER, it was a failure with the critics and at the box office. This time around, Donner has involved himself in a family movie with more appeal and fewer problems.\\nIt should be mentioned that FREE WILLY isn\\'t an error-free film. There are numerous scenes, especially those involving Jesse in his petulant moods, that don\\'t work. While the ending wraps up the major element of the plot, there\\'s still a lot left unresolved, including what the one-dimensional villain Dial (played rather flatly by Michael Ironside) is going to do to those who stole his property. There are also various occasions throughout the running time when logic and reality are conveniently ignored or abandoned altogether. FREE WILLY isn\\'t a movie that stands up well to careful inspection. Most of the flaws aren\\'t major, however, and are easy to overlook.\\nThe movie\\'s biggest asset is its actors. Twelve-year old Jason James Richter does a credible job as Jesse. This may be his first film, but you can\\'t tell it from the polished performance he gives. Lori Petty proves that there are still a few worthwhile roles for women in American films. In her hands, Rae is every bit as strong and capable as any of the men in this picture.\\nStill vivid in my mind is the image of Michael Madsen dancing to the tune of \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" as, with knife in hand, he approaches a tied-up cop. However, while Madsen doesn\\'t bury RESERVOIR DOGS\\' Mr. Blonde, at least he temporarily removes the picture of the psychotic killer from the minds of those in the audience who have seen Quentin Tarnatino\\'s bloody thriller. Madsen\\'s Glen is a somewhat-gruff man who wants a child, but doesn\\'t exactly know how to handle the one that he gets. On paper, this character may have been a cliche, but as portrayed by a veteran character actor, he comes across as a real person.\\nPerhaps the best reason to see FREE WILLY on the big screen is the photography. Both underwater and above-the-surface scenes are filmed with style, and much of the impact will be lost in a television picture. The special effects are good--it\\'s almost impossible to tell where the real whales end and the mechanical ones begin.\\nDon\\'t be put off by the stupid title. FREE WILLY is actually an above-average movie that most people will find something to like about. It only gets preachy once or twice about the \"save the whales\" issue, and is never more obvious than a film like STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME. FREE WILLY has a good message, is enjoyably constructed, and includes several small moments of majesty.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Donald Sutherland, Amy Irving, Rider Strong, Graham Greene, Christopher McDonald Director: Jonathan Heap Producers: Michael Spielberg and Brad M. Gilbert Screenplay: Jeffrey Polman and Christopher Keyser from a story by Michael Lieber Music: Gary Denton Released by Miramax Films\\nThe memories are no longer clear, but Karen Braswell (Amy Irving) knows that it was her testimony twenty-two years ago that sent her father Frank (Donald Sutherland) to jail. Essentially, it was her word against his, and the jury believed her. For over two decades, she has never once doubted that Frank killed her mother but, after he visits her following his release from prison, she has cause to wonder. She then confronts the District Attorney who put her on the witness stand. From him Karen learns that her testimony had been coached, and that the man she has hated since the age of twelve might be innocent of the crime she caused him to be convicted of.\\nSounds like a pretty good basis for a psychological thriller/drama, right? The premise is good and, given a well-written script, the execution could have produced a memorable film. However, somewhere before the midpoint of this movie, things go so badly wrong that BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT collapses, changing from an intriguing motion picture into a formula-riddled, ghoulish disaster.\\nUsually, it\\'s up to independent movie distributors like Miramax to give us unique thrillers (such as THE CRYING GAME). However, in this case, Miramax has reached into its grab-bag and drawn out something that couldn\\'t possibly be any more Hollywood-like. With little to claim in the way of originality (except perhaps the setup), BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT is a cross of a number of recent thrillers. The most obvious source material comes from THE STEPFATHER, which is ripped off shamelessly and ineffectively.\\nExactly who is the intended audience for this movie? Simply put, the picture involves a lot of the murder and exploitation that appeals to mass audiences, but there are too many slow-moving sequences to effectively draw from that portion of the film-going population. Also, BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT is opening in a small number of \"select\" theaters including, of all places, several \"art houses\". This is definitely not a picture for the viewers who frequent those venues. It appears that Miramax, normally known as a genius of marketing, has made a major blunder here--not only in distribution, but in backing the production in the first place.\\nFrom a certain point, BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT gets continuously worse. Once it starts down the slippery track of cinematic ugliness, it seems to embrace the descent. Plot twists cease to make sense, characters lose the tentative three-dimensionality they had been striving for, and the audience stops caring about what\\'s going on. And, of course, the body count mounts. We\\'re treated to several rather bloody and brutal murders.\\nAmy Irving, hardly looking like herself with straight blonde hair, gives a reasonably effective performance, but eventually the script and dialogue get the better of her. Similarly, Donald Sutherland starts out strong, but as the plot grows progressively more ridiculous, his part becomes flat. Graham Greene is uniformly unimpressive in a role that is completely superfluous.\\nThe only thing that BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT is adept at is showing off the Arizona countryside. So much running back and forth goes on that it\\'s impossible not to get an eyefull of the sand, buttes, and canyons. Unfortunately, as the movie progresses, the scenery becomes far more interesting than a story that becomes as ridiculous as it is predictable.\\n',\n",
              " \"Date Released: varies Running Length: 1:33 Rated: NC-17 (Graphic violence, language, nudity, rape)\\nStarring: Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde, Andre Bonzei Director: Remy Belvaux Producers: Belvaux, Poelvoorde, and Bonzei Screenplay: Belvaux, Poelvoorde, Bonzei, and Vincent Tavier Released by Roxie Releasing French with English subtitles\\nMAN BITES DOG is a pseudo-documentary that follows the killing sprees of the murderous Benoit (Benoit Poelvoorde). With cameras rolling, he calmly explains his theories about killing people and weighing down the bodies so they won't float to the surface of whatever river or lake he dumps them in. He then proceeds to slaughter person after person, respecting neither age nor sex nor race, and murdering in a wide variety of ways from strangulation to a bullet to the head. All the while, the film crew trails him, heedless of the danger they put themselves in, and uncaring as they are drawn deeper and deeper into the psychotic, criminal world of their subject.\\nAs a short, this could have been a brilliant, blistering satire on society's views of violence and how it relates to movies. However, MAN BITES DOG is a full-length feature and, as such, spends a little too much time with its subject. Thirty minutes, or even forty-five, would have been a perfect length, but by the end of the third half-hour, certain elements of this movie (namely Ben's endless philosophizing) have grown tired. The violence has lost its edge and the movie has begun to meander.\\nNevertheless, despite the possibly-excessive length, there is still a lot to praise in this obscure effort by a trio of previously-unknown Belgian film makers. They have taken violence in the cinema to its ultimate limit and created an always-irreverent, often darkly funny look at killers and victims.\\nEvery moment of this film is shot documentary-style in grainy black-and-white. This pseudo-realism, complete with choppy editing and unsteady, hand-held camera shots, gives an eerie air of legitimacy to MAN BITES DOG. Added to that, the three main characters in the film all use their real names. The film makers are Remy and Andre, and the killer is Benoit.\\nBenoit possesses an especially interesting personae. Heartless as a killer, he's actually a fun guy to be around most of the time. He loves his girlfriend and adores his family. He's smart and thoughtful, often giving lengthy discourses on various aspects of life and death. Then, the next thing you know, he's blowing someone's brains out or raping a woman while her naked husband looks on in horror.\\nAn issue addressed by MAN BITES DOG is how intimately the media becomes involved in the stories they cover. Are they simply reporting the facts or, by their mere presence, are they participating in them? The answer given by this film isn't obscure as the movie makers slowly come to assist Ben in his various crimes. At first, it's just little things like shining a light in a certain spot, but it doesn't take long before they're actually joining in.\\nAt one time or another, comparisons have been made between this film and a couple of other recent, gut-wrenching productions--HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER and RESERVOIR DOGS. From my point-of-view, while there are superficial similarities between these pictures and MAN BITES DOG, the basic thrust is radically different. RESERVOIR DOGS and HENRY are both serious movies. MAN BITES DOG approaches itself and its subject with tongue planted firmly in cheek.\\nOne of the most hilarious moments in the film comes when Ben has a shoot-out with another killer. After Ben kills his rival, the film crew catches up with him standing over the body. At that moment, another group of men with cameras show up--they had been doing a documentary about the exploits of the now-dead man. Dark, twisted humor like this characterizes MAN BITES DOG.\\nThe limited budget of the film shows, but in a way that adds to the genuine feel of what we're seeing. The plot has a couple of twists that allow us to see various emotions from all of the principals of MAN BITES DOG. Nevertheless, through the entire movie, the only character to be effectively developed is that of the killer, Ben.\\nObviously not a movie for everyone, MAN BITES DOG boasts graphic displays of murder and rape. There's very little of the human body--inside or out--that isn't shown at one time or another during the course of this movie. Nevertheless, if you do venture to see MAN BITES DOG, you would have to be made out of stone to miss the visceral, sardonic impact of a highly-unusual film.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Date Released: 7/30/93 Running Length: 1:33 Rated: PG-13 (Language, dead animal carcasses, brief nudity)\\nStarring: Mike Myers, Nancy Travis, Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer, Brenda Fricker Director: Thomas Schlamme Producers: Robert N. Fried and Cary Woods Screenplay: Robbie Fox Music: Bruce Broughton Released by TriStar Pictures\\nCharlie MacKenzie (Mike Myers) hasn\\'t had the best luck with women, although the problem is more with him than his dates. He can\\'t commit (the notion of marriage frightens him to death), so whenever a relationship starts to get serious, Charlie finds an excuse to dump her. Hey, if she smells like beef vegetable soup, that\\'s a good enough reason. This time, however, Charlie is really smitten. There\\'s only one problem--an increasing amount of evidence seems to point to Harriet (Nancy Travis) as being the mysterious Mrs. X, a woman who is suspected of having married, then killed, three men.\\nA good indication that this movie didn\\'t work for me is that I never cared whether or not Nancy Travis\\' Harriet was an axe murderer. The characters--and it\\'s not just her\\'s--are so paper-thin that it doesn\\'t make a difference who lives or dies, and who does the killing. There isn\\'t enough life in these people even to consider them caricatures.\\nP. D. James need not worry. The creative team behind this film is not poised to steal away her title of the \"Queen of Crime.\" Mysteries are supposed to be complex, intriguing, and beguiling, with the audience unsure of the truth until the very end. None of these things is true of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER. In fact, the solution is so obviously telegraphed that it\\'s possible to have the answer fifteen minutes into the movie. Of course, given the number of logical flaws in the resolution, it\\'s a safe bet that you won\\'t have gotten everything right. It\\'s impossible to predict things that don\\'t make sense.\\nSo, having established that there\\'s no reason to care for the characters and that the murder mystery plot is as feeble as they come, that leaves only the comedy to comment on. As I\\'ve said before, any movie can overcome flaws if it\\'s funny enough. Laughter is the best paint to hide the cracks in the story. John Cleese\\'s A FISH CALLED WANDA is an excellent example of this. Unfortunately, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is not.\\nNot only is the humor banal, it\\'s only fitfully amusing. For every joke that works, there are half a dozen that fall flat. Apparently Mike Myers thinks he\\'s a lot funnier than he actually is. The whole Scottish shtick with Charlie\\'s father (also played by Myers) wears thin quickly, but Myers keeps pushing it long after it\\'s ceased to elicit more than forced chuckles.\\nThere are three nice cameos in the film. The best of these belongs to Alan Arkin, who plays a nice police chief trying to act tough to please one of his detectives. Arkin is only in a few scenes, so there\\'s not enough time for the gag to get overused. Also good is Charles Grodin as a car driver who refuses to let his vehicle be commandeered. Finally, although not quite as good as the other two, but still worth a mention, is Phil Hartman\\'s Alcatraz security guard. Excepting perhaps Leslie Nielsen, few actors do deadpan better than Hartman.\\nThere\\'s nothing in SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER to make this film worthwhile entertainment. It\\'s about as unspectacular a production as there is, with the typical level of juvenile comedy that the writer, director, and actors think is funnier than those stuck in a theater watching the picture.\\nSneak previews of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER paired this movie with WEEKEND AT BERNIE\\'S 2. The thought of sitting through these films back-to-back makes me shudder. One at a time is bad enough, but both in four hours? Of the two, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is the better production. Not much better, but an improvement nonetheless. Faint praise indeed, considering the competition.\\n',\n",

On board are Beldar (Dan Aykroyd) and Prymaat (Jane Curtin). Because of the state of their ship, they are forced to seek refuge on this planet rather than conquer it. Unfortunately, Beldar lacks a green card, so it doesn\\'t take long before the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) finds out about him. With a baby on the way, Beldar gets a job first as an appliance repair person, then as a cab driver, to make enough money to buy a house in New Jersey. However, even as the Conehead family goes in search of the American Dream, Gorman Seedling (Michael McKean) of the INS goes in search of them.\\nIt\\'s amazing that there\\'s such a merchandising push surrounding this film. Not only are there Conehead dolls, figurines, and other assorted paraphernalia, but Subway restaurants have a deal with Paramount to market a \"Mass Quantities\" meal (Subway also has a prominent product placement in the film). All of this may turn out to be a huge miscalculation on someone\\'s part. Based on the audience I saw this picture with, CONEHEADS may be headed down the same road as LAST ACTION HERO (which was a much better film).\\nOccasionally, the ten-minute sketch on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE was good for a chuckle or two, but given an extra eighty-minutes, CONEHEADS turns into a tedious bore. It\\'s hard to believe how anything utilizing the services of the normally-engaging Dan Aykroyd could be so completely unfunny (then again, he was in DOCTOR DETROIT, but even that had a couple of amusing moments). I didn\\'t laugh out loud once during this entire motion picture, which is a bad sign.\\nI expected stupid humor, silly humor, or bizarre humor, but not no humor. The scenes in the previews are unfortunately representative of the entire movie, with the quirky speech patterns of Beldar and Prymaat being the big selling point. Oddly enough, one of the snippets I saw the most frequently--that of Aykroyd opening a six-pack and guzzling down the beer--is playing somewhere on the cutting room floor. It didn\\'t make the final print.\\nCONEHEADS boasts some nice special effects when the setting shifts from Earth to Remulak. While there\\'s nothing groundbreaking here, there\\'s a nasty monster (which looks like something out of RETURN OF THE JEDI) that\\'s done well enough to be believable, and the Remulakian space fleet looks imposing.\\nThe movie starts out okay, but it\\'s hard to keep a story this thin going for long, and by the half-hour point (around the time that Connie Conehead is born), it becomes painfully obvious that the decision to create a full-length feature out of this subject material was a colossal mistake. Even the presence of numerous past and present SNL cast members (including Chris Farley, Jon Lovitz, Jan Hooks, and Phil Hartman) can\\'t save this overbloated, poorly-conceived tripe.\\nLovers of the Coneheads sketches will probably find this film entertaining--and perhaps even enjoyable. They\\'re about the only ones that will be true of, though. For everyone else, CONEHEADS will be much like an endurance contest--and the one who sticks it out to the end may not be the winner.\\n',\n",

Unfortunately, circumstances conspiring against him. His fourteen year old son Nick (Edward Furlong) has run away from Jack\\'s sister\\'s farm, where he was staying, and has sought out his father. At first, Jack seeks to send the boy back, but when Nick won\\'t budge, he has no choice but to let him stay. Their relationship is strained, however, and Jack isn\\'t a very good role model. With each passing day, problems mount, and the easy money offered by Jack\\'s old way of life becomes a temptation increasingly more difficult to resist.\\nIt\\'s a gross disservice to AMERICAN HEART to describe it thematically as a \"white BOYZ \\'N THE HOOD\", but that phrase gets across the kind of story that director Martin Bell and screenwriter Peter Silverman are trying to tell. This movie is about the life of poor whites struggling to make it in the inner city. The setting is Seattle, but it could just as easily be any other city in the United States. As was true with BOYZ, the problems--and their lack of solutions--are universal.\\nSet against the backdrop of poverty and violence is the father-and-son relationship which forms the core of the movie. Jack and Nick don\\'t have a great rapport, but as the movie progresses, they struggle to find some sort of connection. Jack doesn\\'t know how to be a good parent, and really doesn\\'t want to start trying, but it\\'s obvious that he loves his kid and wants Nick to have better opportunities than he had.\\nAll three subplots are as engaging as the main story. One, which follows the development of Jack\\'s affair with Charlotte, a female pen-pal (Lucinda Jenny) he started corresponding with while in prison, is exceptionally well-written, especially considering the dynamics that her presence adds to the already-uncertain father/son relationship. Nick resents Charlotte\\'s presence, feeling that she is taking away time that Jack should be spending with him.\\nAs the film progresses, Nick gets a girlfriend of his own--Molly (Tracey Kapisky), a fifteen year old streetwalker whose mother is a topless dancer. Molly introduces Nick to, among other things, drugs and crime. Despite Jack\\'s warnings that she\\'ll break his heart, Nick can\\'t stay away from her. She\\'s as addictive as the Marijuana that he smokes with her.\\nThen there\\'s the constant re-appearance of Jack\\'s old partner, Rainey (Don Harvey), who wants either Jack or Nick to accompany him on his next job--the robbery of a jewelry store. Considering the poor state of Jack\\'s finances, it\\'s a tempting offer, but he realizes that to attain his modest dream of traveling north to set up a life in Alaska, he has to keep his hands clean. Whether Nick can resist the lure of \"easy money\" is another matter altogether.\\nAMERICAN HEART throws formulas out the window. When you expect something to happen, don\\'t be sure that it will. There\\'s certainly no adherence to a Hollywood-type resolution. The atmosphere throughout this film is stark, but the tone is not so relentlessly bleak that it disallows a little humor. Given the dark nature of the movie, each of the few lighthearted moments is needed.\\nJeff Bridges, who has shown a capacity for playing grungy, downtrodden men throughout his career, gives an excellent performance here. Jack is the kind of man you can sympathize with--a villain trying to go straight, and you can see and feel him through the image that Bridges presents. While this probably isn\\'t the actor\\'s career role, he brings his character to life, infusing him with believability and energy.\\nWould that Edward Furlong does as well with Nick. Furlong, whose top roles to date have come in a couple films demanding little in the acting department (TERMINATOR 2 and PET SEMETARY 2), displays his lack of ability in AMERICAN HEART. For the most part, he has two modes: a blank face and a peeved expression. Anything else is a bonus. Perhaps it\\'s just a case of underplaying every scene. Fortunately, few scenes demand that Furlong carry them, and he has a fine supporting cast to keep audience recognition of his faults to a minimum.\\nAMERICAN HEART is the kind of hard-hitting, issue-confronting drama that are few and far between these days. The film is in limited distribution, so it may be difficult to find but, given the opportunity, it\\'s definitely worth a look.\\n',\n",

When Lieutenant Tom Graham (Harvey Keitel), the racist cop in charge, has trouble obtaining the full cooperation of the Nakatomo execs, Special Services liaison Lieutenant Web Smith (Wesley Snipes) is summoned for help. Along the way, Smith receives a call on the car phone telling him to pick up Captain John Connor (Sean Connery), a man known to be well-versed in Japanese traditions and, in the opinion of some, a Japanese sympathizer. Nothing about this investigation is straightforward, but as more is revealed about the details of the case, Connor and Smith find themselves \"in the warzone\" of a business battle in which life is a commodity easily lost.\\nMichael Crichton\\'s RISING SUN, in addition to being a gripping mystery/thriller, functioned as a scathing attack on American apathy to Japanese economic aggression. In fact, in his afterword to the novel, Crichton says, \"The Japanese are not our saviors. They are our competitors. We should not forget it.\" Statements like these earned RISING SUN the dubious distinction of being a Japan-bashing novel. Now, with the arrival of Philip Kaufman\\'s film, the protests which greeted the book\\'s publication have started anew.\\nAlthough the movie RISING SUN is mostly faithful to the written work which inspired it (Michael Crichton gets his second co-screenwriting credit of the summer, although he dropped out of this project early on), much of the anti-Japanese sentiment has been toned down. There is little that someone watching the film with an unbiased eye will notice. Great pains are gone to the present as many positives as negatives in the Japanese way of life, and there are as many sleazy Americans as there are Japanese in the movie. Crude Asian stereotypes and caricatures are avoided, and care is taken to give the good guys a few vices and the bad guys a few virtues.\\nWith the exception of an ill-timed and confusing ending, the movie follows the general plotline of the book surprisingly well. There are changes of course, but nothing as wholesale or drastic as what destroyed the screen version of THE FIRM. Despite altering the specifics of the killer\\'s identity, the main culprits remain the same. A few additional action scenes have been added (Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes enter into a hand-to-hand struggle with a bunch of Japanese thugs) to keep the audience\\'s attention, and a great deal of Crichton\\'s detail on Japanese culture has been dropped. It fits nicely into the printed version, but would have made the film talky and overly long.\\nThe most obvious book-to-movie change is the casting of black actor Wesley Snipes as a character that is white in the book. Actually, as things turn out, the race of Lieutenant Smith becomes almost irrelevant, except in one scene new to the movie where Smith uses a bunch of his ghetto buddies to help him out of a scrape. With much of the intended comedy failing in this instance, this was not one of the better alterations. It\\'s far too silly.\\nOne of the problems with getting a rising star of Wesley Snipes\\' stature to play opposite Sean Connery is that Lieutenant Smith can\\'t simply be the Watson to Connor\\'s Holmes. Admittedly, there was some friction between the two in the book, but it\\'s nothing like what\\'s present in the movie, where the two almost come to blows (actually, Smith wants to fight while Connor looks at him like an amused parent with a misbehaving child).\\nThe mystery itself is well-presented, with the usual twists, turns, and red herrings. The scenes with Tia Carrere\\'s video guru, as she attempts to uncover the doctoring that has been done to a laser disk containing a video copy of a surveillance camera\\'s recording of the murder, are among the most fascinating moments of the film. What\\'s done to the disks certainly makes you realize that pictures--whether moving or not--can no longer be trusted.\\nThe ending is a little sloppy, with a bit too much \"Hollywood\" added, and a long, drawn-out scene with Snipes and Carrere that\\'s pointless. I would have left RISING SUN with a slightly-better taste in my mouth had the final moments been pruned out. Apparently the writers wanted the solve the one outstanding mystery of the film in the most idiotic way possible.\\nConnery, who reportedly was Crichton\\'s \"model\" for John Connor during the original writing, seems born to play the role. He slips into it with ease and, as always, is a joy to watch. Wesley Snipes is a little erratic , unexpectedly having a few instances where his performance doesn\\'t ring true. Harvey Keitel, underused as the bigoted cop who opens the investigation, seethes with spoken--and unspoken--hatred for everything Japanese.\\nDirector Philip Kaufman, who has previously tackled the book-to-screen adaptations of THE RIGHT STUFF and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, knows how to create a taut, tightly-paced film. There aren\\'t many letdowns in RISING SUN; the film moves implacably on, gathering steam as it goes. The authentic-sounding Japanese music of composer Toru Takemitsu helps the movie\\'s tone immeasurably.\\nRISING SUN is a mixed bag that contains more positives than negatives. Those who have not read the book will probably have a better impression than those who have (although they will wonder about the inclusion of certain seemingly-irrelevant characters--such as Smith\\'s wife--whose roles in the film have been chopped down to virtually nothing). Then again, that\\'s almost always the case with film adaptations. At least in this case, lovers of the book won\\'t be shaking their heads in horror as they did with THE FIRM and SLIVER. RISING SUN is a pretty good movie, but it\\'s still a better novel.\\n',\n",
              " \"THE LONG DAY CLOSES is a film that takes several months in the life of Bud (Leigh McCormack), a twelve year old boy growing up in 1956 Liverpool, and gives us a series of glimpses into some of the most ordinary, everyday moments that occur. This is a movie without plot and with precious little characterization. It moves along at a snail's pace, progressively losing more and more of the audience as it becomes apparent that absolutely nothing is going to happen.\\nTHE LONG DAY CLOSES is very much the visual equivalent of a verse or a poem: beautiful images, but no narrative (that's not to imply that poems often don't have deeper meanings). This movie is a visual feast and a cinematographer's dream, but for the average movie-goer, eighty-three minutes of odd camera-angles and interesting shots is too much.\\nThe audience at the showing I attended numbered about twenty at the start of the film. By the end, it was down to about fifteen. Personally, I don't think the movie was bad enough to walk out on, but I can understand why those who left did so. Movies can survive without coherent stories if they have solid, three-dimensional characters. THE LONG DAY CLOSES has neither and, as a result, ends up being an overly-long bore. Numerous opportunities for character development are left dangling, and we're forced to watch a bunch of people we never get to feel for. Even Bud, who's in nearly every scene, is flat and uninteresting.\\nSupposedly, Terence Davies has filmed his childhood memories. That's an interesting notion, and in the context of the movie, it's easy to see how this could be the case- a great deal of attention is paid to the smallest details. Unfortunately, except in unusual circumstances, the mundane recollections of a person aren't the kinds of cinematic gems designed to captivate an audience. There are a few incidents in THE LONG DAY CLOSES that briefly caught my attention, but they couldn't hold it. On those rare occasions when the film managed to strike a responsive chord within me, it let the opportunity slip away. Then it was back to staring at meaningless images on the screen again.\\nI can't recommend THE LONG DAY CLOSES to any but the most devout art film students and die-hard lovers of unusual cinematography. For anyone else that happens to see this movie, they will likely find the title a fitting one. After getting out of the theater, it will certainly seem like it's been a long day.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Anyone remotely familiar with the Robin Hood legend knows the basic story behind this parody. Robin (Cary Elwes) is the dashing hero who, along with his band of Merry Men (which includes members Will Scarlet O\\'Hara and Achoo the Moor), roams Sherwood Forest as the champion of the common people. His sworn enemy is the evil Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees), and his One True Love is Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck), she of the Everlast chastity belt. To win the heart and hand of Marian, Robin must defeat the Sheriff and his master, Prince John (Richard Lewis).\\nImagine an amalgamation of THE NAKED GUN, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, and you have a pretty good idea what to expect from MEN IN TIGHTS. This is a film packed start-to-finish with satire, puns, one-liners, and other assorted visual and audile jokes. Nothing is too high-brow or low-brow for Mel Brooks, although you can bet there are more occurrences of earthy humor than that of the intellectual variety. Every opportunity for humor, no matter how feeble or juvenile, is seized upon.\\nThere have been several parodies already this year (LOADED WEAPON ONE, HOT SHOTS: PART DEUX!, and LAST ACTION HERO come to mind), none of which have attained the level of MEN IN TIGHTS. That\\'s not to say that this is a masterpiece of any sort, but its jokes are more clever, more original, and more consistently funny than those in the other movies. In a HOT SHOTS-type film, the humor gets stale by the end of the first half-hour, and most of the laughs have dried up long before the final credits roll. Mel Brooks, on the other hand, has enough experience (not to mention flair) with this kind of motion picture, that he knows to vary the humor so that the gags don\\'t wear thin before the running time has expired.\\nThat\\'s not to say that everything Brooks does works. There are a fair share of clunkers in MEN IN TIGHTS. But with such a non-stop barrage of jokes, regardless of what percentage work, there\\'s not much time in between laughs. And whether your kind of humor is along the lines of Shakespeare or Cheech and Chong, there\\'s something in this movie sure to provoke laughter.\\nIn many ways, this is the Mel Brooks of old, the same master of humor that brought us classics like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and BLAZING SADDLES. MEN IN TIGHTS is not as original, inventive, or hilarious as those offerings, but it\\'s a reasonable offering and certainly not in the same dubious category as such Brooks duds like LIFE STINKS. In terms of scope, potential, and execution, this Robin Hood parody is along the lines of SPACEBALLS, the Brooks take-off on STAR WARS.\\nThere\\'s a fairly strong element of MONTY PYTHON in this movie. While no one in their right mind would dare put this film on the same level as THE HOLY GRAIL, there are moments in MEN IN TIGHTS that the British comedy troupe would be proud of. Most notably, perhaps, is the rendition of the musical number, \"Men in Tights,\" which bears a passing resemblance to the Pythons\\' \"Lumberjack Song.\"\\nIn a story that closely parallels the Kevin Costner account, Cary Elwes does his best Errol Flynn imitation--a fine job acting serious and swashbuckling amidst all the silliness around him. The other major players do reasonable jobs, from Roger Rees giving an over-the-top performance that couldn\\'t quite match that of Alan Rickman (from PRINCE OF THIEVES) to a too-subdued Amy Yasbeck.\\nAs is frequently the case, those with cameos steal the show. Dom DeLuise shows up for one scene doing a superlative lampoon of Marlon Brando from THE GODFATHER. Patrick Stewart is on hand to imitate Sean Connery\\'s King Richard from PRINCE OF THIEVES. Not only does he strike as regal a figure as Connery, but he does an excellent job of mimicking the accent.\\nThere are so many jokes in this movie that it\\'s difficult to pick out a memorable one or two. Among the more subtle ones, I was partial to the \"moving mole\" on Richard Lewis\\' face. Nearly every time we see Prince John, his rather sizeable mole has moved somewhere else. At one point, the Sheriff even feels compelled to mention this. Then there\\'s Mel Brooks as Rabbi Tuckman (instead of Friar Tuck), who gives \"half off\" circumcisions. Most of the overblown musical numbers are also fun, with obviously-dubbed singing voices and rappers fulfilling the function of a Greek Chorus.\\nParodies are hard films to do, as the mediocre success of so many recent ones has shown. No matter how ripe a film or genre might be for mocking, unless you know how to do it, there are no guarantees. Fortunately for MEN IN TIGHTS, Mel Brooks has been doing this kind of thing for decades. As the ads say, \"The legend had it coming\", and this film certainly dishes out all that the Merry Men can handle--and more.\\n',\n",
              " 'Two twins, separated at birth, grow into adulthood never knowing each other, and living lives that evolve along very different paths. Freddy Ace (Matthew Modine) is a small-time gangster, a cold-hearted hit man and driver for local Mob boss Paris (Fred Ward). Freddy\\'s whole goal is getting ahead, and he has his eyes set on the top position. In contrast, Henry Petosa (also Modine) has almost no ambition whatsoever. He\\'s a shy, reclusive auto mechanic who has trouble relating to others, especially members of the opposite sex.\\nI have no idea whether EQUINOX is a cleverly-devised satire on these kinds of \"identity movies,\" or whether it\\'s a bad melodramatic addition to the genre. This ambiguity in itself is not a good sign, since if the director was going for the parody, he should have done something to tip off the viewers. Instead, while we get a few hints that this might be the case, there are at least as many pointing to the other alternative.\\nThe characters are all weird. Not \"weird\" in a delightful, quirky sense, but in a way that feels annoying. There\\'s no one to relate to, and writer/director Alan Rudolph doesn\\'t attempt to make any of his principals accessible to the audience. Freddy is cold-blooded and aloof, a man who feels like God after committing a murder. Henry is emotionally-crippled, unable to relate in normal social situations. His on-again, off-again girlfriend Beverly (Lara Flynn Boyle) is just as fragile. She\\'s frightened of sex and constantly refers to herself in the third person. The rest of the cast populating this movie is no more healthy.\\nExcept in a few places where Rudolph makes it clear that he\\'s poking fun at something, the dialogue is atrocious. Most of the lines spoken by Henry sound scripted (rather than natural), and Freddy is constantly spitting out hard-boiled dialogue from a grade B detective flick. There are times when it\\'s almost painful to listen to these people speak.\\nThe acting is uniformly unimpressive--ranging from pedestrian to downright bad. Matthew Modine, around whom the entire film revolves, does not do a good job. In pictures like GROSS ANATOMY and WIND, where he\\'s required to play an annoyingly cocky young man, he does a reasonably convincing job. Here, however, he overacts. He\\'s better as Freddy than Henry, but neither role is a masterpiece of subtlety, and it\\'s clear that his grasp of either character is limited.\\nLara Flynn Boyle isn\\'t particularly impressive either. It seems that she, like Modine, felt a need to go over-the-top to show the emotional fragility of Beverly. There are a few instances when she\\'s on-target, but those are the exception rather than the rule. When she and Modine are together, it\\'s sometimes like a contest to see who can do the worst job.\\nAs Henry\\'s neighbor Rosie the prostitute, Marisa Tomei uses her characteristically energetic style to overcome dramatic lapses in her performance. Her scenes (even though most of them include Modine) are the high points of this film. Contrast what she does to the hysteria of Lori Singer, whose half-dozen appearances as Freddy\\'s wife cause winces.\\nA pair of normally-reliable actors, Fred Ward and M. Emmett Walsh, produce characters with flatter personalities than what they\\'re capable of, which opens up the question of how responsible the director is for the work of those acting in EQUINOX. Ward at least avoids embarrassing himself. Not so for Walsh, who is hideous as he goes way over-the-top.\\nIt\\'s too bad that EQUINOX is so riddled with problems, because there\\'s a lot of soil here ripe for tilling. While there\\'s nothing new in the premise of twins with radically different personalities, this has a unique angle that, if produced more coherently, could have been the foundation for a genuinely worthwhile movie. Even given all the problems of EQUINOX, there\\'s something in the concept that encourages the viewer to stick with it, if for no other reason than to see what happens if and when the twins finally meet.\\nActually, Henry\\'s life alone is worthy of a movie. Freddy isn\\'t a very interesting character, and there are few scenes with him that provoke more than a passing interest, but Henry has a fascinating life. His relationship with Rosie and her baby is sadly underdeveloped. More time is spent on his affair with Beverly, but there\\'s still a lot left unexplored. A few more scenes with these two might have helped the movie immensely.\\nEQUINOX\\'s basic storyline is interesting enough to have held my interest for the one-hundred plus minutes. However, from the beginning, I was aware of how saturated with problems the film\\'s execution is. Beyond the initial draft of the plot skeleton, nothing appears to have been done right. Casting is dubious, scriptwriting sophomoric, and direction contributing to, rather than alleviating, faults.\\nIf the viewer chooses to look at EQUINOX as a straight spoof, the movie still doesn\\'t work, although many of the worst scenes take on a less embarrassing tone. Given that perception, however, there\\'s too much that no longer makes sense, such as why there are so many dry, straight scenes, including an ending that\\'s designed to deliver a \"powerful\" message. This is a hard film to decipher, and one that\\'s not really worth the effort.\\n',\n",
              " 'Despite his innocence, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) has been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. On the bus ride that takes him to the prison where he will spend the rest of his days, Kimble is accompanied by three other prisoners. When they stage an attempted escape, the driver of the bus loses control and it plunges down an embankment. Kimble is free. Ninety minutes later, Federal Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives on the scene to coordinate the search for the fugitive. So, while Kimble flees Gerard and his men, he begins his search for his wife\\'s real killer--a mysterious one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas).\\nTHE FUGITIVE is loosely based on the 1960s television series which featured the late David Jansen in the title role. The film takes a lot of liberties with the original premise and characters, weaving a story that barely resembles the one which entertained TV audiences more than twenty years ago. Back then, Dr. Kimble was on the run for week after week, and there was more to each episode than the chase. Now, however, the flight lasts two hours, and catching the criminals is all that\\'s on anyone\\'s mind.\\nOddly, even though THE FUGITIVE is an admitted chase movie, the scenes before the hunt begins are among the best of the movie. Everything surrounding the murder and trial, all told in a tremendously well-edited fifteen minute prologue, is engrossing. We don\\'t see much of the relationship between Richard and Helen Kimble, but what we\\'re presented with gives us insight into the double tragedy faced by the doctor. Not only is his beloved wife dead, but he\\'s the one believed by everyone to have killed her. Kimble\\'s character, revealed through these scenes, is well in place by the time his sentence is read.\\nFollowing the opening scenes, we\\'re treated to over a half-hour of nonstop action as Gerard and his men go after Kimble. Well-photographed and directed with a flair, this part of the movie keeps viewers on the edges of their seats. Most importantly, when on the run, Kimble acts like an intelligent human being. Equally as refreshing, the lawmen are his match, not a bunch of uniformed dunces being run around in circles.\\nIn fact, it could be argued that both Kimble and Gerard are too intelligent, not to mention too lucky. The plot is far from airtight, and there are a number of contrivances that come into play to bring about the resolution. How much of these you accept depends on how much license you\\'re willing to give the film makers. Considering the overall quality of the movie, I think they deserve some room to maneuver, and most of the plot hiccups didn\\'t bother me.\\nThe movie\\'s pace flags somewhat during the second hour as the pursuit cools down and Kimble\\'s own search for the one armed man takes up screen time. There\\'s a little more talking and less action during the middle portion of the movie. Of course, the action predictably starts to build again as the closing moments arrive. The ending lacks originality but is nevertheless more satisfying than not.\\nMost of THE FUGITIVE\\'s problems center around Kimble\\'s investigation of his wife\\'s murder. There are too many leaps of intuition and handily placed clues. The murder mystery is not well-constructed and there\\'s no way that the audience can figure out who\\'s responsible for the killing until the film reveals it (unless they use the old tried-and-true method of guessing based on who is among the least likely of suspects). Simplifying this part of the story might have resulted in a more tightly constructed plot, and a little less confusion about the motivation of some of the characters.\\nPersonally, I wasn\\'t that interested in Kimble\\'s search. Sure, I wanted him to find the one armed man, but the lure of THE FUGITIVE is the cat-and-mouse chase between the doctor and Gerard. These moments are at the heart of the movie; they make the picture work because it\\'s through them that suspense is developed. Witness the scene at the dam--the tension as the two main characters confront each other is palpable. A little more of this Kimble/Gerard interplay might have put THE FUGITIVE squarely on the same level as another of the summer\\'s big thrillers, IN THE LINE OF FIRE.\\nWith all apologies to Harrison Ford, who turns in a far more emotive and less wooden performance than in PATRIOT GAMES, the real acting standout is Tommy Lee Jones. For a man whose star has been on the rise for the past couple of years, this may be the movie that finally gets him into the upper echelon of today\\'s performers. He invests his character with charisma and energy and, as Gerard\\'s grudging respect for Kimble grows, so does our appreciation of what Jones is doing with his seemingly straightforward role. Assuming that Kimble is the good guy (which the script goes out of its way to make clear), that means that Gerard, who\\'s chasing him, is the bad guy. And, as the film progresses, we can\\'t help starting to like him.\\nWhile no one could accuse THE FUGITIVE of having a masterful insight into human nature, that\\'s not why this film was produced. There\\'s an odd moment or two when an element of someone\\'s behavior strikes a responsive chord, but basically the characters are developed only enough to keep us interested in them as the chase proceeds. They, like the sometimes overplotted story, are subordinate to the hunt. Fans of the old TV series will find echoes of the show here, but most of this version is new. \"Innovative\" is not a legitimate description of THE FUGITIVE, but \"entertaining\" is.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Robert Townsend, Marla Gibbs, Robert Guillaume, James Earl Jones, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby Director: Robert Townsend Producer: Loretha C. Jones Screenplay: Robert Townsend Music: Cliff Eidelman Released by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer\\nJefferson Reed (Robert Townsend) is the meekest of meek school teachers, living in a neighborhood that is rapidly being overrun by the Golden Lords, a drug-dealing and violence-loving gang. One night, however, Jefferson has an unexpected rendezvous with a green, glowing meteor. The collision imparts him with a number of superhuman powers, including the ability to see through solid objects, move with lightning-quick speed, and (of course) fly. The problem is that Jefferson\\'s basic personality is the same. He\\'s a reluctant superhero, not wanting the job of cleaning up the neighborhood. But as word gets out about \"Meteor Man\", the Golden Lords intend to make sure that he doesn\\'t have a choice in the matter.\\nTHE METEOR MAN is a mostly-unsatisfying film that can\\'t decide whether it wants to spoof superhero films or join their number. In attempting to walk a fine line between the two alternatives, it succeeds at neither. Actor/director/writer Robert Townsend has invested a lot of effort and energy into this production, but little of it is well-focused. Four editors worked on the film in post-production, and the final offering has the confused, choppy look of something put together by a committee.\\nThere\\'s a message behind the silliness--you don\\'t have to be a superhero to stand up against the drug lords currently taking over our cities. If decent human beings band together, it doesn\\'t demand someone who can leap buildings to clean up the streets. It\\'s a worthwhile thing for a movie to say, but Townsend gets a little too preachy about it. Subtlety, at least in this case, is not one of THE METEOR MAN\\'s qualities.\\nNormally in a movie of this kind, you don\\'t worry too much about characterization. However, when Townsend decides to introduce dramatic elements into his story, the film comes to need men and women who are more than comic-book caricatures. They aren\\'t there, however. There isn\\'t anyone in this movie that simulates a real human being. Even Townsend\\'s Jefferson, with by far the greatest screen time of anyone, fails to display more than a couple of carefully-contrived emotions.\\nSome elements of the storyline are annoying. It\\'s impossible to explain why, after discovering his superpowers, Jefferson doesn\\'t go out immediately and get rid of the bad guys. In fact, his father (played by Robert Guillaume) advises that he do just that. But Jefferson dawdles around while his mother makes him a costume, occasionally knocking off a few token Golden Lords and letting the running time of the film move towards acceptable motion picture levels. The entire manner in which Meteor Man confronts the villains is inexplicable. A battle that should be one-sided and quickly ended turns into a an all-out war with the superhero made into the underdog by a plot contrivance.\\nThere are a few funny scenes in the film, and at least one running gag that works (look at James Earl Jones\\' always-changing wigs). Towards the end, positioned right in the middle of the climactic battle between Jefferson and the leader of the Golden Lords, is a truly hilarious moment that, despite its odd placement, is worth mentioning. If THE METEOR MAN had boasted more such scenes, it would have been far less tiresome to watch.\\nNo one can deny that Robert Townsend had good intentions when he put THE METEOR MAN together, but the final product doesn\\'t have consistency or coherence. With its positive message and lack of serious violence, this is a reasonable choice for a children\\'s film, but something of a lame offering for adults. There\\'s not enough of any one element--comedy, satire, drama, or action--and the mixture isn\\'t any more palatable than the individual ingredients. THE METEOR MAN is a superhero movie that lacks punch.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Miho Nikaido, Tenmei Kano, Sayoko Amano Director: Ryu Murakami Producers: Yoshitaka Suzuki, Tadanobu Hirao, and Yosuke Nagata Screenplay: Ryu Murakami Music: Ryuichi Sakamoto Released by Northern Arts Entertainment Japanese with English Subtitles\\nAi (Miho Nikaido) is a Japanese callgirl specializing in domination and bondage. When we first meet her, she\\'s nearly naked and spreadeagled with restraints holding down her arms and legs. Meanwhile, her client, after whispering to her that she should trust him, blindfolds and gags her before forcibly injecting her with heroin. Welcome to the world of TOKYO DECADENCE, where prostitution is a dangerous and ugly profession, not the thing of romance it has been portrayed as in Hollywood\\'s sanitized PRETTY WOMAN.\\nAi doesn\\'t have the personality to be a prostitute. Not only is she shy, but she\\'s a romantic. In fact, she once fell in love with a client who treated her gently--something someone in her position isn\\'t used to. Unlike Richard Gere, however, this man was interested in her for one night only. After that, he didn\\'t care what happened to her.\\nAi is looking for happiness, and finding it hard to come by. She consults a fortune teller who informs her that to get her wish she has to do three things: put a telephone book under her television set, stay away from museums in the eastern part of the city, and wear a ring with a pink stone on her middle finger. Ai is so desperate that she follows these instructions to the letter. Of course, they don\\'t help. For someone mired in her situation, there don\\'t seem to be any solutions.\\nTOKYO DECADENCE is a gut-wrenching and horrifying look at the world of prostitution. Equally, it\\'s a condemnation of the seedy, secret side of Japanese society that is kept hidden from the outside world. The problems illustrated in the movie are not unique to that country, however. Decadence is a human condition, and where men and women are, there too will be the ugliness shown in this picture.\\nThose who feel that RISING SUN is guilty of Japan-bashing may be very disturbed by the impressions presented by TOKYO DECADENCE. Perhaps because it\\'s made by Japanese film makers primarily for a Japanese-speaking audience, the producers felt no need to pull punches. Writer/director Ryu Murakami\\'s theme can be summarized in one sentence from the movie: \"It\\'s Japan that\\'s wealthy, but it\\'s wealth without pride.\" Psychologists have always talked of how powerful men have a need to be dominated--Murakami has applied this to the collective psyche of an entire country.\\nThe sex in this film, while abundant and explicit, is definitely not erotic. Viewers are more likely to be sickened than titillated. Murakami didn\\'t make this film to tickle people\\'s libidos; he wanted to bring out the potential ugliness that can come through sex. In that, he has succeeded abundantly. TOKYO DECADENCE is graphic but not gratuitous, and I can\\'t go into details about some of the humiliation that Ai is put through without proof that the reader of this review is over eighteen.\\nTOKYO DECADENCE is so bleak that without the inclusion of a brief scene designed primarily for comic relief, this would have been as close to unbearable a movie as I have ever seen. As is often true of cautionary tales, the stuff of TOKYO DECADENCE is too strong for mere entertainment.\\nThat having been said, there is still a story with characters. Of all the people we meet, only Ai attains depth, but she is brilliantly fleshed-out by the script and portrayed by actress Miho Nikaido, who has to put a lot of herself on the line to appear in some of TOKYO DECADENCE\\'s scenes. Few performers are willing to expose themselves to this much humiliation and degradation--even if it is only on film--to bring a character to life.\\nFor most of the movie, the plot is reasonable, if not overly-involving. Until the end, that is, when it all comes crashing down. Often, movies conclude with let-downs, but in the case of TOKYO DECADENCE, there\\'s a complete collapse. The last twenty minutes are so poorly put together that they\\'re virtually not worth sitting through. The drawn-out finale is tedious, and seriously damaged my overall impression of the movie. Five minutes would have been more than enough time to bang home Murakami\\'s final point.\\nProduction-wise, the picture is a mixed bag. The musical score is poor, sounding like a badly-synthesized composition lifted directly from some cheap 1970s American flick. The cinematography is equally of dubious quality. In attempting to highlight the dispiriting nature of the film, many of the scenes were shot in conditions of low lighting. Unfortunately, sometimes things are so dark that it\\'s difficult to figure out what\\'s going on.\\nTOKYO DECADENCE is a movie that will appeal only to a select few. Strong stomachs and a willingness to see almost anything are requisite. The movie is rated NC-17 for a reason. Those who take a chance on this film may be disappointed by some of what it has to offer, but the overall experience won\\'t soon be forgotten.\\n',\n",
              " \"For twelve years, Johnny Dingle (Andrew Lowery) has been hopelessly in love with Missy McCloud (Traci Lind). Now, with the approach of the Senior Prom, Johnny finally gets up the courage to ask Missy out. Unfortunately, before he has the opportunity, he's killed in a convenience store robbery. But never fear! Not even death can hold back Johnny and, despite the annoying tendency of several of his body parts to fall off, he returns from the grave to go to the prom with Missy. Surprisingly enough, she's a lot more attracted to him now that he's dead than she ever was while he was alive (I guess he gets points for being unusual).\\nThose expecting this to be an unapologetically silly movie are right on the money. However, as idiotic as it is, MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK is not without a few redeeming qualities. Much like last year's BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, there are enough clever touches to the film to keep it from becoming tedious or unwatchable. I would never argue that MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK is a good movie, nor would I recommend it to anyone, but it's not nearly as awful as the title would suggest, and there are at least a few worse pictures available at the moment.\\nOne of the primary problems with this film is that while it has a fun, lighthearted tone, it isn't nearly funny enough. Far too many jokes fall flat, and those that do succeed are more likely to provoke an amused smirk than any genuine laughter. The premise is somewhat underused, at least as far as humor goes.\\nMY BOYFRIEND'S BACK is pretty good at self-parody, though. The nonchalant way that everyone treats Johnny's return is clever and enjoyable to watch. Nothing that happens seems to shock anyone; they take it all in stride. In fact, Missy is flattered that a guy would do something like come back from the dead for her.\\nJohnny's mother (Mary Beth Hurt) and father (Edward Herrmann) are especially farcical. They are proud of their son's achievement, but determined to do everything necessary to keep things normal. When it turns out that Johnny needs to eat living flesh to keep him from decaying, his mother goes to the store and picks up a stray kid in case he wants a snack. When the neighbors threaten to burn Johnny, Mom pulls out a gun and aims it in their direction.\\nThere is an anti-racist, anti-prejudice message that doesn't work. I recognize that the people behind MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK are trying to do something positive, but comparing the plight of the undead--a truly ridiculous situation to begin with--to the bigotry faced by many minorities is more than just a bad idea; it's insensitive. I can even see where some might find it downright offensive.\\nIt's surprising how good the cast is. They do their jobs in the right spirit, giving excellent, deadpan (no pun intended) performances that keep this film from going into cardiac arrest. How fine actors like Mary Beth Hurt and Edward Herrmann can keep straight faces through these proceedings is difficult to conceive. Andrew Lowery's Johnny may be the star of the show, but they steal the spotlight.\\nOne inventive touch found in the movie serves to emphasize the comic-book quality of the story. Many of the scenes are started with cartoon panels that turn into live-action sequences. Director Bob Balaban has fun blending fantasy, comedy, and parody together, and does a surprisingly smooth job of it. If only his script had more bite, this could have been a worthwhile film.\\nAs it is, MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK is about as mindless as a movie can get. That's not always a bad thing to say about a film, but it certainly isn't an heartfelt endorsement. Maybe when it comes on cable, it will be worth a look--that's about the right medium for something of this sort. MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK has its moments, just not enough of them.\\nThis review is copyright 1993 by James Berardinelli\\n\",\n",
              " 'Starring: Max Pomeranc, Joe Mantegna, Joan Allen, Ben Kingsley, Laurence Fishburne Director: Steven Zaillian Producers: Scott Rudin and William Horberg Screenplay: Steven Zaillian based on the book by Fred Waitzkin Music: James Horner Released by Paramount Pictures\\nAt the tender age of seven, Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc) becomes fascinated by the game of chess. Without giving up Little League baseball, he learns how to play, hanging out with Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne) and a group of speed chess hustlers who occupy nearby Washington Square. It isn\\'t long before Josh is able to beat them all. His father, looking to take him to the next level, employs ex-chess master Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley) as a teacher. Under Pandolfini, Josh matures as a player and, for the first time, he starts to fear losing.\\nSEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is based on the true life story of Josh Waitzkin who, at the age of sixteen, is currently the highest-ranked American player under eighteen. It isn\\'t just Josh\\'s tale, however. The name and image of the mysterious chess genius Bobby Fischer infiltrate this movie. Fischer is as much an icon to this game as Babe Ruth is to baseball.\\nHow important are games to the American way of life? Have they become so crucial that we lose sight of the people playing them? And at what point does the need to win become so important that the game ceases to be fun?\\nThese are some of the questions that SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER probes. It certainly can\\'t answer them (since there are no definitive solutions), but the film offers fodder for thought as it explores Josh\\'s early career and examines the relationship between the young chess master and his sports writer father, Frank Waitzkin.\\nJosh starts playing chess because it fascinates him. As soon as Frank recognizes his son\\'s gift, however, he begins to apply subtle pressure. Winning becomes important--perhaps too important--and Josh is afraid that to fail at the game is to risk losing his father\\'s love. It\\'s then that chess becomes a burden and he stops enjoying it.\\nJosh has two mentors--the street-smart Vinnie, who teaches him to play the opponent, not the board; and Bruce Pandolfini, a man who has suffered an unspecified loss in an unnamed competition, but knows the game inside out. Each has a different perspective to offer, and Josh learns from them both. One lesson, however, he is unable to take to heart--he cannot hate his opponents, no matter how much they despise him.\\nWe never learn exactly what demons haunt Pandolfini, and it\\'s a credit to this film that it doesn\\'t make them explicit. There are enough clues that they can be guessed at, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER relies upon the intelligence of its audience to put the pieces together.\\nThere are four key relationships in this film, each of which is explored with varying success. Even the weakest, that of Josh and his mother (Joan Allen), has an emotional depth unusual for the amount of screen time accorded to it. Of all the adults in the film, only Bonnie Waitzkin never loses sight of what\\'s best for her son.\\nAlso treated in a cursory fashion is the unusual friendship that develops between Josh and Vinnie. It\\'s clear that the two are fond of each other, and Vinnie\\'s tactics become important to Josh\\'s development as a player, but we don\\'t see enough of the two of them together to get a genuine sense of the mutual respect that grows between them.\\nPerhaps the most complex relationship is that of Josh and his father. While Frank never stops loving his son, there comes a point when Josh\\'s winning becomes more important to him than to his son. This kind of pressure is too much to put on a young boy, no matter how gifted he is, and it takes a threat by Bonnie to make this clear and put the situation in perspective.\\nAlso explored in some detail are Josh\\'s interactions with Bruce Pandolfini. Like Frank, Pandolfini loses sight of his young charge\\'s innocence and age, and tries to mold him into a chess-playing machine. In some sense, Pandolfini is perhaps attempting to fight the ghosts of his past through Josh. It isn\\'t until the end of the film that he is finally able to accept and love his student for who he is.\\nBen Kingsley and Joe Mantegna do excellent jobs bringing their characters to life. These are men with faults, but it\\'s those imperfections that enable us to empathize with them. Neither actor has an overabundance of screen time with which to develop a personality, but good performers can do quite a bit with an economy of scenes. Having only a handful of appearances, Laurence Fishburne faces an even more difficult challenge, but he nevertheless manages to convince us that he\\'s a true friend to Josh, concerned more about the boy\\'s happiness than his success. Joan Allen, despite often being relegated to the background, gives a convincing portrayal of a mother who cares so much about her son\\'s well-being that she\\'s willing to take him away from his father, if necessary, to assure it.\\nWhen casting SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, the production team decided that instead of choosing a young \"name\" actor who might know little or nothing about chess, they would choose someone who was a chess player first and an actor second. Realism was important to the film makers--they wanted chess-playing viewers to be spared the indignity of watching someone faking playing the game.\\nIn Max Pomeranc, an excellent choice was made. Not only is he an experienced (as experienced one can be at that young age) chess player, but he acquits himself admirably in the role of Josh. He\\'s not the best child actor to grace the screen, but he avoids the awkward obviousness of many.\\nSEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is an intensely fascinating movie capable of involving those who are ignorant about chess as well as those who love it. The focus of the film is less on the actual game than it is on the people, emotions, and pressures surrounding Josh. It is a tale of human trials and triumph, not a sports movie that panders to a certain segment of the population. Chess may not be the most exciting activity to watch, but SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER makes for engaging entertainment.\\nOne final note: even though this film might seem like a perfect family movie with its lack of violence, profanity, and sex, I would caution parents considering taking their children to SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER. With its focus on character development and drama, many younger viewers will likely become quickly bored. This is an \"adult\" movie ill-suited to those with short attention spans.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Charles Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard, Tom Sizemore, Elisabeth Shue Director: Ron Underwood Producer: Nancy Roberts and Sean Daniel Screenplay: Brent Maddock, S.S. Wilson, Gregory Hansen, and Erik Hansen Music: Marc Shaiman Released by Universal Pictures\\nOne night in 1959, four people (Charles Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard, and Tom Sizemore) board a city bus in San Francisco, each suffering a major life crisis. They are never given a chance to solve their problems because the bus crashes and all on board are killed. However, instead of being assumed into heaven (or the other place, as the case may be), they find themselves stuck on earth as the \"imaginary friends\" of just-born Thomas Reilly (who grows up to be Robert Downey, Jr.). When it becomes apparent that the quartet are seriously warping Thomas\\' personality (he talks to people that no one else can see), they decide to fade from sight and leave him on his own. The separation isn\\'t permanent, though. Twenty years later, they reappear to straighten out Thomas\\' life, as well as to set their own personal ghosts to rest, before they are whisked away to inhabit new bodies.\\nThe above description attempts to capture some of the nuances of a needlessly-convoluted and poorly-conceived storyline that someone should have had the intelligence to pare down to reasonable levels. HEART AND SOULS, as is often the case with films scripted by four people, is at odds with itself, frequently not seeming to know where to go next and, on those occasions when it has a set direction, proceeding in the most confused and unsatisfying manner possible.\\nFor nearly fifty years, film makers have been trying to recapture the drama and magic of Frank Capra\\'s 1946 American classic IT\\'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. To this date, no one has succeeded. HEART AND SOULS is yet another stab in the dark, and not only does it fail, but it turns out to be worse than many of the efforts before it. In retrospect, it\\'s hard to find many good things to say about this movie.\\nThe thing about IT\\'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is that it took its time developing the character of its protagonist, George Bailey. Not until the final quarter of the movie does the supernatural intervention occur. In HEART AND SOULS, while approximately a half-hour is spent setting the story up, there are too many characters to flesh out. None of them are sufficiently fleshed out, and the rest of the movie ends up falling flat because of it. Character identification is crucial in a film of this nature and, when it doesn\\'t happen, the picture is doomed.\\nFrom start to finish, the script consciously and mechanically tries to manipulate the audience to laughter and tears. Partially as a result of being too obvious about its intentions and partially because of heavy-handed direction, it doesn\\'t succeed. Most of the jokes aren\\'t very funny and the scenes designed to strum the heart strings are more embarrassing that touching. When a rapport hasn\\'t been developed between the characters and the audience, attempts to make us cry can end up looking rather silly.\\nHEART AND SOULS has a fine cast, which is why it\\'s surprising that the acting is so lackluster. I suppose part of the blame can go to the behind-the-scenes team that \"crafted\" this dud, but the performers can\\'t be absolved of all blame. Of the major participants, only Tom Sizemore does a reasonable job. Robert Downey, Jr., relies too much on what he did in CHAPLIN (whenever one of the spirits enters his body he gives a Tramp-like lurch). Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard, and Charles Grodin are flat, and Elisabeth Shue displays all the range of a water pistol. David Paymer, who was decent in Billy Crystal\\'s MR. SATURDAY NIGHT, manages to be incredibly tedious in a small role as the bus driver.\\nThere are a few energetic scenes that save this production from being an utter debacle. Chief among these is a concert given by B. B. King (appearing as himself) where Thomas, under the influence of Charles Grodin\\'s Harrison Winslow, gives a throbbing rendition of the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" There are also a few mildly humorous interludes with a police officer, although the conclusion of that particular subplot is laughably bad.\\nFor all of its attempts to weave a spell on the audience, HEART AND SOULS manages to be annoyingly blatant in what it\\'s trying to do. Nevertheless, if you\\'re someone who drools over happy endings, this may be the movie for you (provided you can stomach the film\\'s many other shortcomings). It doesn\\'t just have one of these, but five, each more cloying than the one before. A rare treat for those who don\\'t mind going into sugar shock.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: John D. LeMay, Kari Keegan, Erin Gray, Steven Williams Director: Adam Marcus Producer: Sean S. Cunningham Screenplay: Dean Lorey and Jay Hugely, based on the story by Hugely and Adam Marcus Music: Harry Manfredini Released by New Line Cinema\\nThis may be a first: a movie title that gives away the ending of the film. Come to think of it, some of the other FRIDAY THE 13TH films did the same thing, didn\\'t they? Actually, they lied. Any bets about this one?\\nIt\\'s the dark of the night at Camp Crystal Lake and some stupid girl who didn\\'t watch any of the other FRIDAY THE 13TH movies is taking her clothes off. What better (and more obvious) prelude to the arrival of Jason for his ninth resurrection. After failing to skewer or behead his victim on the first try, he chases her through the woods before finally cornering her in an apparently empty clearing. Oops. Jason has made a mistake. His prey is actually a plant (not of the flowering variety, although the performance is a bit wooden) and he\\'s suddenly surrounded by military-type men with all kinds of firepower. Fourth of July! It doesn\\'t take long before the killer is a mound of burnt up organs. It looks like it\\'s all over. That is, until the coroner takes too close a look at Jason\\'s oversized heart. Now you and I both know that was a dumb move.\\nSurprise, surprise! This film will not make my bottom ten list of the year. In fact, it won\\'t come close. Despite a legacy of horrible previous efforts under the FRIDAY THE 13TH umbrella (of which I have seen only three--parts 1, 2, and 8--all on cable), this film actually has a few good elements buried amidst all the dead bodies, dumb dialogue, and mystical nonsense. Chief among these is that JASON GOES TO HELL has chosen to turn the series in the direction of open self-parody.\\nThis movie doesn\\'t take itself seriously--at least not too seriously. In between the various maimings, it takes time out to poke fun at the series\\' reputation, including a reference to going up to Camp Crystal Lake to \"do drugs, have premarital sex, and get slaughtered\". It\\'s this warped sense of humor that actually makes the film somewhat entertaining. In a genre where it\\'s often difficult to tell satires from serious attempts, the parodies in JASON GOES TO HELL are far too obvious to be accidental.\\nOf course, horror fans won\\'t be disappointed. There are the requisite jump-out-of-your-seat-scares (complete with a burst of over-the-top music), not to mention a high body count. Actually, in terms of showing the gruesome deeds, JASON GOES TO HELL is pretty tame. Sure, there are a lot of shots of organs and blood, but most of the murders happen off screen. You know how the people are slaughtered, but you aren\\'t subjected to watching the details.\\nIn the end, Jason gets his--again. But is he really dead this time? Despite the assertion that if he\\'s skewered by one of his relatives, he\\'s finally gone, I somehow doubt that. Unless this film runs a serious financial deficit--which seems unlikely given the opening weekend turnout--Jason will be back. In fact, we\\'re even given a substantial clue about his next cinematic adventure.\\nAfter the disappointing lack of success of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART EIGHT, Paramount Pictures, the previous distributor of these films, gave up on the series. New Line Cinema quickly snatched up the rights. The executives had a great idea for a crossover now that they owned Jason and Freddy Krueger. My question is, why not try to get Michael Meyers (the killer from the HALLOWEEN series, not the guy who should be axed for foisting SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER on us)? Then there could be a real gathering of the Who\\'s Who of Maniacs. As of now, however, clues point to it being just Jason and Freddy. Oh well.\\nMake no mistake from any slight praise that I might give this film--it is in no way a good movie. Seeing it with the right rowdy audience while not spending money on it (if I hadn\\'t gotten in for free, I wouldn\\'t have seen this film) makes Jason\\'s latest apparition bearable. For anyone who is even luke-warm about this genre, don\\'t take this as a recommendation to see the film. But for blood-and-guts lovers everywhere, the return of Jason is reason enough to trundle down to the local multiplex for a midnight showing. After all, you wouldn\\'t dare consider seeing this movie during the day!\\n',\n",
              " \"Starring: Kate Maberly, Heydon Prowse, Andrew Knott, Maggie Smith, John Lynch Director: Agnieszka Holland Producers Fred Fuchs, Fred Roos, and Tom Luddy Screenplay: Caroline Thompson based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett Music: Zbigniew Preisner Released by Warner Brothers\\nOrphaned in India, where her transplanted English parents lived before falling victim to an earthquake, Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly) comes to the cold, aloof household of her uncle, the widower of her mother's twin sister. There she is viewed as nothing short of a meddlesome nuisance by the housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith), and is ordered to stay in her room until told to come out. Mary doesn't obey, of course, and in her explorations discovers the room of her sickly cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse), from whom she is intentionally being kept. Outside, she finds something even more wondrous: the secret garden of her late aunt. With the help of Dickon (Andrew Knott), a local boy who can talk with animals, Mary sets to work reclaiming the garden from the weeds and brambles that had overrun it.\\nTHE SECRET GARDEN has at least two things going for it: remarkable acting and mesmerizing cinematography (by Roger Deakins). Even without much of a story, this film could stand alone on those two qualities. It's amazing to find a child, especially one as young as Kate Maberly (who, at the age of ten, has already been in numerous BBC TV productions), capable of carrying a film. And Maberly isn't all sugar-and-spice. Her Mary has plenty of bitterness, disdain, and arrogance to make her virtually unbearable at times.\\nMaggie Smith, always the consummate professional, is excellent as the nasty housekeeper. Mrs. Medlock isn't all bad, however, even though her few moments of humanity could hardly be called heartwarming. Her real motives, while frequently pursued in the most misguided and warped of methods, are nevertheless good and true. Her dislike of Mary comes as much from a perception of the danger that the young girl could present to Colin Craven as from the sudden injection of randomness into a previously well-ordered existence.\\nTHE SECRET GARDEN is based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 novel, and director Agnieszka Holland (recently at the helm for EUROPA, EUROPA and OLIVIER, OLIVIER) has taken care that the screenplay follow the book. Ms. Holland is an avowed fan of the story, having read it over and over again as a child. The care and effort she poured into this, her first Hollywood effort, is proof enough of that. She has created a picture that is magical for viewers of all ages.\\nThe story is essentially about the redemption of two damaged children. Mary, while hale of body, is an emotional cripple. She grew up unloved in a household where her selfish parents handed her off to the servants. Colin is neither physically nor emotionally whole. His father, never having recovered from the death of his wife, rarely visits Colin in the sickroom, leaving the boy's care to the implacable and unaffectionate Mrs. Medlock.\\nThe secret garden is a place of rare and wondrous beauty, and it becomes the emotional balm that heals all wounds, both physical and psychological. There, Mary learns how to feel and Colin how to walk. These two form a fast friendship both with each other and with Dickon, the younger brother of one of Mrs. Medlock's maids.\\nTHE SECRET GARDEN combines drama, fantasy, and a little bit of light Gothic horror (the old house with its strange noises) into a satisfying mix. The film is a visual feast, from the eerie insides of Misselthwaite Manor to the time-lapse photography of blooming flowers. Zbigniew Preisner's score adds to the atmosphere without ever becoming obvious or intrusive.\\nI'm not sure how some younger viewers will react to this film. Most of them will miss the subtle nuances that Agnieszka Holland brings to the screen (which are aimed at adults), but the story, centering as it does around children, will be enough to captivate many. Obviously, THE SECRET GARDEN is not an action film, and those weaned on that genre are likely to find this production stale. Nevertheless, it is an excellent family film for those willing to immerse themselves in its leisurely pace--the picture proceeds just fast enough to keep the audience's attention while exhibiting a great attention to detail. THE SECRET GARDEN has something to offer everyone, and that's a rarity among movies these days.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Andy (Steve Parlavecchio), Trevor (Patrick McGaw), and Billy (Joseph Lindsey) have grown up together in the Long Island community of Five Towns. By their own admission, their friendship started almost from birth. However, relationships that were once strong begin to fracture with the onset of adulthood. A drug bust gone bad sends Trevor to prison and he emerges a disillusioned man. Billy becomes a big-time hood using Andy as his gopher, a role that the somewhat-timid twenty-three year old is desperate to escape from.\\nAMONGST FRIENDS is another story about crime in America, but instead of telling about the \"have nots\" of society, the film focuses on three boys who come from wealthy, respectable families. Bored and satisfied with comfortable lives where all their conventional wants are met, they crave something different and exciting. Andy\\'s grandfather, who built his fortune as a bookie, and his gangster friends become inspirations and role models.\\nThe three main characters couldn\\'t be more different. Trevor is a dreamer and a romantic, a man to whom freedom and love mean more than all the money in the world. His feelings for Laura (Mira Sorvino, daughter of GOODFELLAS actor Paul Sorvino) bring him back to Five Towns following a lengthy absence, and it\\'s his return that sets in motion the events of this film.\\nBilly is, plain and simple, a thoroughly unlikable bully. In fact, if there\\'s an obvious flaw in any of the characters, it\\'s that he has absolutely no redeeming characteristics. It\\'s hard to see what anyone else could possibly see in someone so completely despicable.\\nOf the three, Andy is the most unsatisfied with life. Each of his friends has something while he\\'s still striving for that one big score that will fill the gaping void. It isn\\'t that he needs the money--he can get that from his parents any time he wants it--but the cash is a way of proving that he can hit the big time, even if it is gained through drug deals.\\nSolid performances by the lead actors, not to mention strong support from a cast of equally-unfamiliar names, bring these people to life. Through the entire film, there\\'s not a bad acting job to be found, and a couple of the players excel. Patrick McGaw is superlative, as is Mira Sorvino, despite the limitations of the role. Also worthy of note is Ms. Sorvino\\'s grandfather, Ford Sorvino, who has a series of hilarious cameos that provide most of the film\\'s scarce comic relief. Apparently, there\\'s a lot of talent in that family.\\nAMONGST FRIENDS never lets up. Scene after scene flashes by, often moving the plot along at dizzying speeds. Movies less economic with dialogue and story development might take an hour longer to tell the same tale. The transitions in AMONGST FRIENDS are frequently abrupt, and writer/director Rob Weiss obviously doesn\\'t believe in wasting screen time.\\nIn fact, it could be argued that the film moves too fast, especially at the beginning when it takes a while to sort out who the individual characters are and exactly what they\\'re up to. The voiceover narrative by Andy doesn\\'t help much since there\\'s too much information to absorb in such a short time.\\nThis is one of those low-budget motion pictures (it cost only $900,000 to make) that succeeds wildly because it takes chances. Eschewing formulas is dangerous territory for a production team that wants their product to hit it big; fortunately, there\\'s still a market for this kind of small, independently-made movie. Apparently the big distribution companies know something good when they see it, though, because Weiss has recently signed a three picture deal with Universal.\\nDon\\'t look for easy answers in AMONGST FRIENDS, because you won\\'t find them. In fact, the film doesn\\'t really offer any solutions. The problems are obvious, as are the tragic consequences of certain actions, but if Weiss has any answers, he doesn\\'t share them with us.\\nIn the final analysis, AMONGST FRIENDS works not because it\\'s an expose of upscale, suburban violence and drug use, but because it takes the time to develop its characters so that the events which swirl around them involve us. Emotional honesty is difficult for many films, but this one attains it, and when something devastating happens on screen, the reverberations shake the theater and the people sitting in it.\\nThat\\'s the kind of experience that AMONGST FRIENDS offers. It\\'s not safe, comfortable, or lighthearted, nor is it completely original, but it\\'s definitely memorable. With plenty of movies available offering fluff, this is among the rare exceptions that don\\'t pull punches and always hit hard.\\n',\n",
              " 'What happens when a bored wife thinks her kindly old neighbor commits a murder? Woody Allen attempts to answer the question in his latest cinematic endeavor, MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY.\\nCarol Lipton (Diane Keaton) and her husband Larry (Woody Allen) are caught in a routine, commonplace marriage - until Carol turns into Nancy Drew following the death of a neighbor. It all seems like a open-and- shut case of a heart attack, and the police aren\\'t thinking foul play, but Carol becomes suspicious when the widower of the dead woman (Jerry Adler) doesn\\'t mourn \"enough\" (\"What should he do\", asks Larry, \"walk down the street sobbing?\"). With the help of Ted (Alan Alda), a close friend who encourages her sleuthing, she begins to assemble \"clues\" to fit her pet theory of a murder. But the evidence is weak, and Larry becomes concerned that his wife is obsessed with a macabre fantasy. He tries to be the voice of reason, but when no one listens to him, he ends up playing along.\\nPart of the fun of MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY is guessing whether or not Lillian House was murdered, as Carol believes, or simply died of a heart attack. In a sense, that\\'s the mystery of the film, and Woody Allen brings across the solution with his characteristic mix of madcap comedy and on-target realism.\\nIn 1979, director Allen made MANHATTAN, a movie that many critics and fans consider to be his greatest effort. Between then and now, Diane Keaton has been absent from Allen\\'s films, and her return in MURDER MYSTERY is a welcome change from helium-voiced Mia Farrow. Ms. Keaton is a breezy, energetic personality, and it\\'s hard to imagine anyone else doing nearly as much with the character of Carol (even though this part was originally conceived with Farrow in mind, and wasn\\'t re-written following the cast change). One need only look at the Allen/Keaton and Allen/Farrow collaborations to determine which pairing worked better, and MURDER MYSTERY merely reinforces this conclusion.\\nSome claim that to have seen one Woody Allen picture is to have seen them all. To say that not only vastly oversimplifies things, but does a great injustice to the individuality of each of Allen\\'s projects. Sure, there are a number of themes that he returns to like a comfortable chair, and the character he plays rarely varies from a basic neurotic type (no one would accuse Allen of having great range as an actor), but each of his films - even those that fail (take SHADOWS AND FOG, for instance) - offers something fresh and unique.\\nHUSBANDS AND WIVES, Allen\\'s previous picture, is a drama with humorous elements. MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY is closer to a straightforward comedy, providing more laughs than anything Allen has done in a long while (he claims to have \"indulged\" himself with this movie). Combined with numerous one-liners, almost all of which work, are several instances of well-timed and well-executed physical humor. Allen pushes all the buttons from wit to slapstick, and rarely comes up empty.\\nIf there\\'s a serious side to MURDER MYSTERY, it\\'s only to be expected. After all, the director has a reputation to maintain, and the movie\\'s principal subject - death - isn\\'t usually a laugh-a-minute riot. Allen also takes a look at love, as the twenty-year marriage of Carol and Larry is put under the microscope.\\nFilm buffs will find the usual number of references to look for, although these are perhaps more explicit than in many Allen movies, and include DOUBLE INDEMNITY, REAR WINDOW, and THE LADY FROM SHANGHI. There certainly may be others, as Allen has a habit of putting more into his films than anyone can hope to get in one sitting.\\nA word has to be said about the annoying cinematography of Carlo Di Palma, who returns after causing audiences motion-sickness with his wobbly, hand-held camerawork in HUSBANDS AND WIVES. While the intention is obviously to draw the viewer into the film, it actually has the opposite effect; the camera cannot compensate the way the human eye can. Admittedly, this method seems less distracting here than in the previous film, although this could be a case of greater exposure breeding immunity.\\nWoody Allen is rarely a big commercial draw, and whether his off-screen antics will boost his box-office take remains to be seen, but MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY may be his most accessible film since HANNAH AND HER SISTERS. This movie is still pure Allen, but the humor is broad-based, and the \"quirkiness\" often associated with the director is kept to a minimum. Frankly, it\\'s been years since I\\'ve enjoyed Woody Allen this much.\\n',\n",
              " 'Take a deep breath and prepare to suspend your disbelief, because in bringing us this summer\\'s first (and probably only) pure action film, Jean-Claude Van Damme and John Woo have given new meaning to the word \"preposterous.\"\\nChance Boudreaux (Van Damme) is a down-on-his-luck ex-merchant marine who got blacklisted after dumping a drug-smuggling captain overboard. Now, he\\'s forced to eek out a living doing whatever odd jobs he can find on the docks and streets of New Orleans. One day, he spies a lady in distress (Yancy Butler) and, using his rather impressive kick-boxing techniques, rescues her from a gang of would-be muggers (and rapists?). In return, she offers him a job: help her find her father, a homeless vet who has disappeared. What Natasha and Chance\\'s search turns up, however, turns out to be a dark and deadly secret that makes them the prey in a vicious cat-and-mouse game run by the evil and ruthless Fouchon (Lance Henriksen).\\nHARD TARGET is, in essence, an example of the victory of style over substance. When it comes to the \"typical\" criteria by which a film is judged, this movie fails badly. Its characters are poorly-developed, the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity, and the acting, at best, is well over-the-top. Nevertheless, on the most basic, visceral level, the film succeeds.\\nThose who went to LAST ACTION HERO and left disappointed because they expected a straight action film, will likely accord redemption to the summer of \\'93 because of HARD TARGET. Albeit with a thinner plot, this is the kind of no-holds-barred chase, fight, and shoot-out picture that has become a Schwarzenegger staple. Van Damme has an accent, the charisma, the physique, and the lack of acting skills. Really, unless you\\'re paying the check, it\\'s hard to tell the difference.\\nAt the helm of HARD TARGET is John Woo, who is internationally-known for not pulling punches when it comes to violence (the two films he is best known for are THE KILLER and HARD BOILED). Indeed, he doesn\\'t merely direct this movie, he choreographs it, turning simple fight sequences into ballets of bloodshed. It\\'s compelling, albeit a little disconcerting, to see violence so lovingly and carefully photographed. HARD TARGET isn\\'t some hack job--a lot of effort went into crafting the picture. Snipped and put back together to avoid an NC-17, the film still offers a lot of mayhem and murder. It would have been interesting to see the cut that represented Woo\\'s initial vision.\\nThere is perhaps a little too much slow-motion photography, and the score, while capturing the flavor of Louisiana, often becomes intrusive. Early in the film, it seems that every time we\\'re treated to a shot of Van Damme, he\\'s walking towards us in slow-motion with his overcoat flapping in the breeze while an unnecessary blast of music blares from the theater speakers.\\nThe first half of the film occasionally slows up for some silly exposition, but by the mid-point, the hunt is underway, and it\\'s all action from there. If, by five minutes into the movie, you haven\\'t put your brain into park, this is going to seem like an utterly ridiculous effort. Those who are willing to get into the spirit are in for a roller-coaster ride directed by a master and acted by someone who knows how to kick higher than most people can jump.\\nI\\'m not going to say much about the plot, because it\\'s far too contrived to be worth mentioning. Suffice it to say that if the success of HARD TARGET depended on it, the movie would be sunk. Even for the action-oriented film-goer, there are a few moments too hard to swallow (where\\'s the \"S\" on Van Damme\\'s chest?). If nothing else, they\\'re good for comic relief which, fortunately (or should I say \"hopefully\") seems to be Woo\\'s intent.\\nLance Henriksen enjoys himself immensely. He\\'s fun to watch, but he goes so far over-the-top that I\\'m not sure it would be justified to call what he does a \"performance\". Regardless, he provides an excellent and much-needed counterpoint to Van Damme\\'s ho-hum delivery. The hero, after all, is good with his kicks and punches, but not his lines. Yancy Butler does a poor job, even considering the company she keeps. Someone who can make Van Damme look like a drama school graduate really needs to take some acting lessons (although, admittedly, there\\'s a scene with a snake where she\\'s fantastic). And couldn\\'t they have gotten someone a little more lively than Wilford Brimley for Chance\\'s lunatic uncle?\\nAnyway, you pretty much get the idea. Without the elegant technique of John Woo, HARD TARGET could have been a real dud. It is not a good alternative to more intelligent thrillers such as IN THE LINE OF FIRE and THE FUGITIVE, but that\\'s not the market it\\'s aimed at. However, those that enter a darkened theater showing this film with a reasonable idea of what they\\'re getting themselves into, are likely to emerge satisfied.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Mandy Patinkin, James Spader, M. Emmet Walsh, Charles Durning, Joel Grey Director: Philip Haas Producers: Frederick Zollo and Dylan Sellers Screenplay: Philip Haas and Belinda Haas based on the novel by Paul Auster Music: Phillip Johnston Released by I.R.S Releasing and Trans Atlantic Entertainment\\nOn the way to New York City, James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) stops by the side of the road to offer a lift to a beat-up and bedraggled stranger. This man turns out to be Jack Pozzi (James Spader), a professional gambler. As the two get to talking, Pozzi tells Nashe of a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to use in an upcoming \"sure thing\" poker game. Intrigued by the idea of some quick, easy money, Nashe offers Pozzi a proposition. He\\'ll advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fifty-fifty. The deal is struck and the two are off to the rural Pennsylvania residence of Flower and Stone (Charles Durning and Joel Grey), where the games begin.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE is a film of many levels. At its most literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which include building a ten-thousand stone wall. However, those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience. While final scene, dripping with meaning, gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot of questions left unanswered.\\nPeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it. There you will find other questions, but these are of a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature. THE MUSIC OF CHANCE explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives. It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust.\\nAt the center of the story are three characters. James Nashe is the basic \"nice guy\" who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost. He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves. On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with. Calvin Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny.\\nMetaphors abound, from the \"wailing wall\" to the \"City of the World\" being built by Willie Stone. In fact, there\\'s so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning. There are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.\\nCharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces, and necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF CHANCE. As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are completely understandable. Calvin Murks starts out as something of an enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip out.\\nJames Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack. M. Emmet Walsh does his usual \"good ol\\' boy\" routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner. The standout, however, is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and battered by fate\\'s cruel whims.\\nThe film\\'s conclusion is it\\'s greatest weakness. Aside from being relatively predictable, it isn\\'t entirely satisfactory. Movies such as this don\\'t have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together. Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and how it all ends up.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption. After all, how many people out for an evening\\'s light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about poker and wall building? Nevertheless, as is often the case with movies such as this, there\\'s more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be seen with the first casual glance. An investment of time is needed and, for the most part, rewarded.\\n',\n",

He starts to re-evaluate the situation, however, when a bunch of ninjas try to kill him. Never fear, though, there\\'s someone around to explain to Johnny (and the audience) what\\'s going on. You see, Johnny and his younger brother are actually princes from a South Pacific island that has been taken over by the evil Colonel Chi (Leslie Nielsen). Until now, they\\'ve been hidden from Chi, but the dastardly dictator has found them at last, and now he wants them dead. So, in true heroic fashion, Johnny decides to go to the island and confront Chi so that his people can be released from oppression. Of course, along the way there\\'s plenty of time for surfing and unfunny jokes.\\nSURF NINJAS could just as easily be called LESLIE NIELSEN\\'S QUEST FOR A FAST PAYCHECK. Actually, even though Nielsen is given prominent co-billing, if you blink, you might miss him. And even for those few moments when he is on screen, he\\'s obviously holding back his talent for a film with greater depth and profundity--like the third NAKED GUN movie. After all, who says you actually have to act to get the money? In SUPERMAN and CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, Marlon Brando proved that you can sleepwalk your way through a role and still get paid handsomely.\\nSURF NINJAS takes the summer\\'s prize for most moronic movie. Considering the competition, which includes a sequel to WEEKEND AT BERNIE\\'S and yet another installment in the never-ending FRIDAY THE 13TH series, that\\'s quite a distinction.\\nDan Gordon is listed in the credits as having written the film. If I were him, I would have sued to get my name removed. The lack of creativity and originality shown in this script might forever ruin his career. Then again, if this is the best he can come up with, maybe Hollywood is better off without him. There are enough second-rate hacks out there anyway.\\nWhat can you say about a movie that bills itself as an \"action comedy,\" yet fails miserably on both counts. The one-liners, aside from attaining the expected level of juvenile predictability, aren\\'t funny, and the physical humor never rises above the standards of a Saturday morning cartoon. Oh, it\\'s a real riot when a guy goes tumbling and thudding down a 300-step flight of stone stairs only to climb back up and do it again. What inspired comedy!\\nAs director, Neal Israel (who really should have taken on the Alan Smithee pseudonym for this project) has to take the blame for the poor quality of the action scenes. Even the worst shoot-\\'em-ups are generally competent in this regard, but SURF NINJAS has a problem. The stunt work is poorly-coordinated and it\\'s easy to predict where an explosion is going to occur before it actually goes off. Why, you ask yourself, are all those people running away from that apparently-barren patch of ground?\\nSURF NINJAS gives family films a bad name. It\\'s curious how unpleasant every movie with \"ninja\" in the title has been. Then again, hearing that something is called SURF NINJAS doesn\\'t exactly conjure up images of solid entertainment. Unfortunately, this picture is far worse than one typically envisions, even considering the name and the stupid tag line of \"Surf\\'s Up! Time to save the world.\" Oh, well. At least seeing this movie wasn\\'t a complete waste. Now I have another worthy contender for a spot on the Worst 10 list of 1993.\\n',\n",
              " 'In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to open an antique shop called \"Needful Things.\" Most of Castle Rock\\'s residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956 Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a necklace that can take away an arthritic\\'s pain. The price asked by Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal, so be it. The only one immune to \"Needful Things\" appears to be Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the carnage starts, it\\'s up to him to stop it.\\nHow is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre? Perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is.\\nWhat at the outset is the film\\'s strength turns into its greatest liability. The basic concept is solid: a gentle-seeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite people\\'s greed to turn them against one another. Unfortunately, once that has happened, the movie doesn\\'t know where to go with the story, so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.\\nThe final scene isn\\'t the problem; it\\'s the one that immediately precedes it. This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen. The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Those that sit through this picture deserve more than they\\'re given.\\nIt\\'s too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise. There are the usual horror staples, like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands. The terror here is more psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock. Leland Gaunt only causes it to surface.\\nMax von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS. He manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance. He\\'s the bad guy, all right--there\\'s never any doubt about that--but he\\'s so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly, that it\\'s almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him. Certainly, it\\'s von Sydow\\'s rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.\\nEd Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great ability in the past, but none of that is evident here. The best of the three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small. Plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature. Harris, who\\'s supposed to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.\\nIf he hasn\\'t done so well with three of the four main actors, at least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton) can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy atmosphere. NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its most banal scenes. Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston\\'s fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.\\nIn the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and this summer\\'s MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed significant versatility and range. Sadly, the same ability is not in evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film. There are a couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle\\'s work, instead relying on \"Ave Maria\" and Grieg\\'s \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\".\\nNEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry. This seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is involved. Since I\\'m not a fan of Mr. King and can\\'t claim to more than occasionally read his work, it\\'s difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books. Whatever the case, in Leland Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year\\'s most intriguing villains. This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn\\'t there. By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything. Sadly, the answer is yes, but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of Max von Sydow.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Roberto Benigni, Herbert Lom, Claudia Cardinale, Debrah Farentino, Jennifer Edwards Director: Blake Edwards Producer: Tony Adams Screenplay: Blake Edwards, Madeline Sunshine, Steve Sunshine Music: Henry Mancini Released by United Artists\\nIn 1964\\'s A SHOT IN THE DARK, Peter Sellers\\' Inspector Clouseau met a young Maria Gambrelli (then played by Elke Sommers, now by Claudia Cardinale). Twenty-nine years later, it\\'s revealed that Maria and Jacques had a brief fling, the result of which was Jacques Gambrelli (Roberto Benigni) who, during the course of this film, comes to be known as Jacques Clouseau Jr. Gambrelli learns of his father\\'s identity while working on the case of the missing Princess Yasmin (Debrah Farentino), the beautiful daughter of an Asian king.\\nNothing is sadder than seeing a once-beloved movie series keep churning out sequels long after its time is past. Thirty years ago, when classics like THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK came out, they were among the best comedies available. Three more Sellers\\' PANTHER movies subsequently were released (THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER, THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES BACK, and THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER), none as good as the first two, but all worthwhile diversions. Unfortunately, Sellers\\' death in 1980 failed to stem the tide of the films which, at that point, should have been ended. THE TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER and THE CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER were produced, neither of which was worth the price of admission.\\nNow, ten years after CURSE, just when we thought we were free of the series, movie #8 comes out. Finally, Blake Edwards has acknowledged that the original Clouseau is dead, not missing (as was the premise in the two early-80s pictures), so to fill in the gap he gives us a previously unknown son, played by Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni.\\nBenigni, star of the farce JOHNNY STECCHINO, is adept when it comes to physical humor, and his abilities are highlighted here in four or five scenes that include heavy doses of slapstick. However, while these produce some laughter, they are largely regurgitations of material from previous PINK PANTHER entries. Beyond copying Peter Sellers\\' style, Benigni has little to do, and less by which to distinguish himself.\\nOld friends like Cato (Burt Kwouk) and Dr. Balls (Graham Stark) are back, even though the thinly-plotted script can come up for no logical reason for them to be there. Each appears only briefly, doing the same old shtick. Of course, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is on hand as well, but he doesn\\'t seem the same. I guess the years have taken away his edge. The anticipated apoplexy when he learns of Clouseau\\'s offspring, is mild.\\nBlake Edwards, although long regarded as a comic genius, has recently turned out a string of barely-watchable films. Gone are the BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY\\'S and SOBs, replaced by such memorable titles as SKIN DEEP (with the infamous condom scene) and SWITCH. Far from bringing him back to the glory days, SON OF THE PINK PANTHER further entrenches Edwards in the pit of mediocrity into which he has descended. Once, we demanded superlative films from him; now, we\\'re just hoping for something somewhat entertaining.\\nThe opening titles are as uninspired as those for any of the PINK PANTHERs. Although they give the big cat his first opportunity to mix with live actors, the interaction is stale and fails to stir a chuckle. It\\'s sad, because I always considered the Pink Panther to be one of the funnier cartoon characters, both on his own and introducing the Clouseau movies.\\nNot only is the animated panther not up to snuff, but the opening theme is sub-par as well. Henry Mancini\\'s well-liked \"Pink Panther\" tune is horribly \"modernized\" by Bobby McFerrin (\"mangled\" might be a better word). At least the end credits retain the original music in its full orchestral splendor.\\nThere\\'s very little about this movie that isn\\'t disappointing. One might make the foolish assumption that for a PINK PANTHER film to be produced out ten years after the last disastrous entry in the series, there had to be a creative reason--preferably something new and inventive. Instead, however, we are lumbered with this cobbled-together effort. If there\\'s a mercy, it\\'s that SON OF THE PINK PANTHER should finally put the Clouseau family to rest. Then again, that\\'s what I thought about THE CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER.\\n',\n",

Living in New York with a well-paying job, a nice home, and a stable relationship (with Simon, played by Mitchell Lichtenstein), everything would appear to be going his way. But his parents, unaware of his sexual proclivities, are expecting a marriage and grandchildren, and Wai hasn\\'t been able to get up the courage to tell them that he\\'s gay. But an apparent solution to the dilemma presents itself when Wei Wei (May Chin), a tenant in a building owned by Wai, must find a way to get a green card or face deportation. As a result, a marriage of convenience is arranged between the pair, and everything seems to be working out well until Wai\\'s parents arrive from China to plan the wedding banquet.\\nWhat at first seems like a simple romantic comedy is actually a deceptively perceptive look at cultural, sexual, and generational differences. And, despite THE WEDDING BANQUET\\'s often-light, occasionally-playful tone, a forceful dramatic structure underlies the film. Of course, this is what usually makes for the best kind of comedy - a movie that cares more about its story and characters than making people laugh.\\nThere are a lot of tangled relationships in this film, but all of them, no matter how complicated or confusing, are handled expertly. Everyone\\'s motivations are clear, and for once there\\'s no villain, unless you choose to name circumstances as the antagonist. It\\'s refreshing when a movie comes along that allows you to enjoy spending two hours with the people on screen.\\nWriter/director/producer Ang Lee, a Chinese-American film maker, displays a remarkable ability to present and balance issues without becoming preachy, and while also avoiding the dangerous trap of cliches and stereotypes. All the characters have their own unique identities, and their emotions come shining through.\\nWhile there isn\\'t anything revolutionary in the story, and some of the \"twists\" are easy to predict, it\\'s never clear until the end how everything is going to be resolved. Given the nature of the central triangular relationship (Wai, Wei Wei, and Simon), I had visions of a horrible, Hollywood-type conclusion that would have destroyed all my respect for the film. Thankfully, that did not happen, which shows the intelligence, good taste, and sensitivity of everyone involved.\\nAlthough it deals with potentially-weighty issues and some very powerful emotional impulses, THE WEDDING BANQUET never becomes bogged down by its own seriousness. Lee manages to keep the production buoyant by including scenes that are often riotously funny.\\nThe actors are uniformly good. May Chin, a huge pop star in Taiwan, gives a complex rendering of Wei Wei, managing to bring across the churning emotions of the one person in this film who really has no one. Despite this being his screen debut, Winston Chao is as impressive as any veteran, and there are no readily apparent chinks in his performance. Mitchell Lichtenstein\\'s Simon could easily have slipped into obscurity, but the actor manages a strong enough presence to avoid such an ignominious fate. Stately and dignified, Sihung Lung and Ah-Leh Gua breathe life into Mr. and Mrs. Gao, Wai\\'s parents.\\nIt\\'s understandable why THE WEDDING BANQUET won the Golden Bear award at the 1993 Berlin Film Festival, and the Best Film and Best Director citations at the 1993 Seattle International Film Festival. There is enough depth in this picture to fill up several movies, yet THE WEDDING BANQUET shortchanges none of its interwoven storylines. While I won\\'t go so far as to say that this is a magical motion picture, it certainly serves as excellent entertainment on more than one level.\\n',\n",
              " 'Date Released: 9/3/93 Running Length: 1:42 Rated: R (Nudity, sexual situations, language, mature themes)\\nStarring: Julian Sands, Sherilyn Fenn, Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith Director: Jennifer Chambers Lynch Producer: Carl Mazzocone and Philippe Carland Screenplay: Jennifer Chambers Lynch; story by Philippe Carland Music: Graeme Revell Released by Orion Classics\\nDr. Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed by Helena (Sherilyn Fenn), a woman with whom he had a brief affair and is now hopelessly smitten. Helena, however, feels nothing but disdain for Nick, and shows it at every possible opportunity. Nevertheless, one day the good doctor manages to lure the object of his desires back to his home. The \"romantic lunch\" doesn\\'t turn out as planned, but when Helena storms away from his house and into the street out front, she\\'s struck by a truck and seriously injured. Not wanting to lose Helena to a hospital, Nick elects to operate in his home lab, amputating Helena\\'s legs, then keeping her captive during her convalescence. When she becomes too difficult to control, he takes things one step further and removes her arms, turning her into \"a possession.\"\\nLike father, like daughter. Those who expected a nice, normal film from the offspring of actor/director David Lynch are in for a big shock. Jennifer Chambers Lynch has borrowed a lot of her father\\'s technique and style, and Mr. Lynch\\'s own response to the film is that he (not surprisingly) \"really liked it.\" BOXING HELENA is far from the beaten track, covering subjects guaranteed to scare away major Hollywood studios and big-name stars. An example is Kim Bassinger, who was signed to play the title role, then backed off when she discovered that the script demanded her to play a character without arms and legs. She lost the battle in court, and BOXING HELENA won not only by receiving a monetary settlement, but by having a much better actress in the part.\\nSuspension of disbelief is crucial to BOXING HELENA\\'s success (and the most probable reason it fails for those who dislike it). So much of what happens during the course of the film is impossible to accept given the logical confines of the real world, so for those unable to slip into the mood of the movie and naively accept the often-absurd intentions of the film makers, BOXING HELENA will be a huge disappointment--a mix of gigantic contrivances and impossibilities of ludicrous proportions. Of course, if one assumes that Ms. Lynch is going for dark comedy, that changes the viewer\\'s entire perspective of the picture, shedding a new and warped light on some of what is supposed to be serious (my own contention is that most--but not all--of the humor is unintentional).\\nOnce it gets beyond a hard-to-swallow setup and into the meat of its story, BOXING HELENA is surprisingly involving and intelligent--especially considering how fingernail sketches of the plot paint the movie. The script is certainly not concerned about the reality of circumstances and the actions of characters, focusing exclusively on the weird and unusual relationship the develops between Sand\\'s Nick and Fenn\\'s Helena, the inevitable captive/captor emotional bond. The movie discloses its terms early, and expects the audience to buy into them, making no apologies for what it is or intends to be.\\nThere are powerful moments in BOXING HELENA, most resulting from the interaction between characters. Neither of the primary parts is three-dimensional, but a fair amount of character development occurs during the course of the movie. A scene where Nick presents the limbless Helena with a gun and offers to kill himself or her at her request is effective because it touches on the core emotions experienced by both parties. There are other such scenes, but intermingled with them are events better ignored--including a dumb subplot involving the search of a boyfriend (Bill Paxton) for the missing Helena, and an even dumber attempt to explain Nick\\'s bizarre actions through flashbacks to a neglectful, promiscuous mother.\\nOne of the things that works against BOXING HELENA is the performance of its lead actor. While Julian Sands doesn\\'t precisely do a bad job, he rejects subtlety in favor of overstatement. While not an over-the-top performance (take a look at what Bill Paxton does for one of those), neither is it an example of studied, careful acting. Too often, Ms. Lynch\\'s direction mirrors the job done by Sands. There are a number of scenes that are handled in a rather heavy-handed way, with a little too much meaningless symbolism thrown in for good measure.\\nFortunately, Sands\\' opposite, Sherilyn Fenn, is superlative, giving an entirely credible performance as she turns a one-dimensional part into a vibrant character. It must be difficult to portray a limbless puppet, but Ms. Fenn never falters, making us forever grateful that the lackluster Kim Bassinger backed out. Admittedly, Ms. Fenn looks a little too good for someone who had gone through Helena\\'s trauma, but that\\'s another area where suspension of disbelief comes into play.\\nThe prosthetics of the amputations are never shown, and Ms. Fenn\\'s own limbs are hidden through simple trickery, so there\\'s no real need to comment on \"special effects\". They are, in this case, no more or less than are necessary to tell the story. Although Helena\\'s armless, legless impotence might be somewhat macabre, it isn\\'t presented distastefully, resulting in a production that\\'s more erotic than misogynistic.\\nA series of about five scenes comprises an ending which will probably polarize viewers into two different camps--those that approve of the choices made by Ms. Lynch, and those who feel cheated and betrayed by them. Personally, I accepted this part of the movie as reasonable, and certainly no more outlandish than what went before. A great deal is explained that would otherwise have remained mystifying. However, I disliked the final scene, especially the voiceover by Julian Sands. If Ms. Lynch wanted ambiguity, she should have left things as they were; if she wanted a clear resolution, she should have added a few more minutes of footage. As it is, her mix of the two methods is decidedly unsatisfactory.\\nThe general opinion will probably be largely negative, but there are people who will love this film. BOXING HELENA has elements to recommend it, but there\\'s a lot that has to be willingly overlooked to get to that. Cynical viewers will not enjoy it, except as something to poke fun at. My own opinion is divided, although I will admit to having enjoyed the picture more than not, but any recommendation I make comes with heavy reservations.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Mark Dacascos, Paco Christian Prieto, Stacey Travis, Geoffrey Lewis, Todd Susman Director: Sheldon Lettich Producers: Samuel Hadida, Stuart S. Shapiro, and Steven G. Menkin Screenplay: Sheldon Lettich and Luis Esteban Music: Harvey W. Mason Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nLuis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs. Determined to do all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis): give him the twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies, he\\'ll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed for the better. Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn\\'t pleased about this at all.\\nGoing into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action films. I was wrong. It\\'s a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message. I think I prefer this sorts of film when it doesn\\'t try to preach. Somehow, sermonizing and beating peoples\\' brains in don\\'t make an appealing combination.\\nDon\\'t look for even a whiff of originality in this film. It takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends. Not that you\\'re likely to care, but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis\\' girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis)? Or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep Luis in line?\\nThere are also a number of transitional scenes that aren\\'t there (although where they got left out, I don\\'t know--they could be on the cutting room floor). For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to Luis that they\\'re no longer kids and, while she admires what he\\'s trying to do, it\\'s over between them since she has a new boyfriend. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully intimate. Talk about a jarring turn of events....\\nThen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably, get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher. Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the President\\'s attention. What\\'s even more astounding is that Luis never gets stabbed or shot. There are some token guns and knives in evidence, but nothing close to what you\\'d expect at the High School from Hell. Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message, not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys.\\nSpeaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to make Silverio the meanest hombre you\\'ve ever laid eyes on. He\\'s nasty, sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat. He deals drugs and runs a chop shop. We never see him kill anyone, but it\\'s a given that murder is on his resume. Heck, for all we know, he eats orphans for breakfast. Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.\\nActually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you\\'re looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt. I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at every possible opportunity). Mark Dacascos is also passable, especially when he doesn\\'t have to talk. Geoffrey Lewis, who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.\\nMost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action goes so fast that it\\'s difficult to figure out who\\'s who. In the climactic \"match,\" the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn\\'t eliminate all the confusion.\\nFor those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure \"cornball,\" you ain\\'t seen nothin\\' yet. Take a look at the final scene of ONLY THE STRONG and you\\'ll note that it\\'s got Pacino\\'s film beaten by a long stretch. Of course, there\\'s a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to.\\nThere is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG. It isn\\'t boring--or at least not too boring. The message it tries to get across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful. If you want somebody to listen, you\\'d better put together something worth listening too, not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.\\n',\n",

Anthony Mann\\'s sense of composition, his use of space, and his graceful camera movements bring to life an ancient tapestry where the transformation of an ordinary man into a legend become almost a mystical experience.\" Lavish praise from Martin Scorsese, one of the forces behind the restoration and re-release of EL CID. Pardon me if I am not wholly in agreement with him.\\nThe story of EL CID centers around the life of Rodrigo Diaz (Charlton Heston), a Castilian knight in 1060 Spain fighting to keep his country from the brink of civil war so that it will retain the manpower and unity necessary to defend itself against the outside threat of the North African Moors. Diaz, called El Cid by his followers, becomes a living legend to the men of eleventh century Spain, and this film willingly expands upon every myth to surround the name of the legitimate historical figure. EL CID is definitely not a good source for a factual biography (the identity of Diaz\\' wife and the premise of the finale are a few of the more obvious occasions when the truth is completely ignored).\\nUsing similar methods and equal care to that which was given to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the restoration of EL CID is an impressive undertaking. The sound quality on this new print is flawless and, for the most part, the picture is better than one would expect from a thirty-two year old film. There are several frames that are far from mint condition, but the overall effect is impressive, and the colors are never washed-out.\\nThe battle scenes of EL CID are breathtaking, and well worth the effort of seeing on a large screen. Video viewing of the climactic struggle would greatly diminish the impact, and it is in this context that it\\'s possible to understand Scorsese\\'s quote. This is definitely a film meant for theaters. The television screen will serve only to limit the high points and magnify the numerous, often-glaring weaknesses. Instead of EL CID seeming like an epic, it could come off looking rather stupid.\\nThat\\'s because beyond the spectacle and pageantry, EL CID\\'s virtues are limited. The costumes and set design are as impressive as the magnificent backdrops against which the turbulent struggles of the armies occur, and the effort necessary to orchestrate the realistic clash of thousands of swords is mind-boggling, but while these things add a great deal to the film, they cannot entirely cover up its shortcomings.\\nActing is by far the biggest problem. While both Charlton Heston and Sofia Loren have imposing screen personalities, neither is capable of projecting real emotion or drawing us into a rapport with the characters. Simply put, Heston and Loren are wooden, and there are only a few occasions on which they manage to make Diaz or Chimene real. The chemistry between them is flat, conveying little, if any, passion. \"Smouldering\" is not a word anyone would use to describe this couple.\\nThe plot is high melodrama with few surprises. Diaz is the hero, and he does all the superhuman things expected from a knight \"with God on [his] side.\" EL CID turns far more often to the ridiculous than the sublime, and the last scenes contain an element that is downright silly. Perhaps if the movie didn\\'t take itself so seriously, there wouldn\\'t be as many opportunities for unintentional laughter, but EL CID is about as self-important as a motion picture can be. It is an epic, after all, but in case we\\'ve forgotten, there\\'s always the needlessly florid dialogue and stentorian score to remind us.\\nObviously, they don\\'t make movies like this any more, and that\\'s both good and bad. While there\\'s a lot in this film that modern pictures don\\'t need to harken back to, it would be nice to see some of the flair. When recalling great battles in recent films, only a few come to mind (LAST OF THE MOHICANS and GLORY, for example), none of which have the scope or sheer power of what Anthony Mann achieved in EL CID.\\nSo, while I\\'m personally not ready to anoint EL CID as the timeless epic classic that it has become, I\\'ll not pepper it with arrows of disdain, either. This is a grand movie with tremendous aspirations that are not always realized. Nevertheless, it\\'s an entertaining, if not transcendental way to spend three-plus hours.\\n',\n",
              " 'Starring: Patrick Swayze, Halle Berry, Sabrina Lloyd, Brian Bonsall, Michael Ironside Director: Darrell James Roodt Producers: Nicholas Pileggi, Anant Singh, and Gillian Gorfil Screenplay: Scott Spencer Music: Patrick O\\'Hearn Released by Hollywood Pictures\\nJack Charles (Patrick Swayze) is a small time crook with a glib answer for every question and two kids in foster care. When his daughter Kelly (Sabrina Lloyd) escapes from juvenile hall and locates her father, Jack tries his hardest to get rid of her, but she persuades him to look for his son Eddie (Brian Bonsall), who is being placed in the same unpleasant place she escaped from, where children are handcuffed and abused. Recognizing the conditions Eddie could be subjected to, Jack kidnaps him from the authorities at gun point, then goes on the run with both kids in tow.\\nUnless infused with some sort of unique energy, road pictures have become a worn-out genre, as proved by FATHER HOOD. It\\'s a mystery to me why films like this get made. Do we really need to spend ninety minutes following the misadventures of two children and an adult (who often displays less maturity than his offspring) as they run around the country trying to get to know one another? How many hundreds of movies and television shows have had the same plot?\\nThere is little to relieve the tedium of this film, except an impressive performance by little-known actress Sabrina Lloyd. Unfortunately, this is not the movie anyone wants to have it said that they gave their most memorable performance in. Hopefully, someone will give her another shot in something where she\\'ll have an opportunity to catch someone\\'s attention.\\nIf I had cared about the characters, perhaps the unbelievable number of plot implausibilities wouldn\\'t have bothered me as much, but no one in this film manages to grab more than a token amount of sympathy, especially not Jack, who is an annoying, arrogant jerk. Give Patrick Swayze credit (if you want to call it that) for playing this guy with the right amount of sleaze to get the audience to actively dislike him. Unfortunately, when he turns over a new leaf (as is inevitable), it\\'s tough to accept.\\nThe two kids have their moments. Actually, I should say that Lloyd\\'s Kelly has her moments. Eddie, as played by Brian Bonsall, a young actor of limited appeal and talent, is pretty much a nonentity. The script tries too hard to manipulate the audience into sympathizing with them, and that immediately put me on guard. Movies of substance rarely resort to such blatant emotional trickery.\\nSmall roles are given to notables like Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, but these two hardly have more than a few moments on screen. Halle Berry, who\\'s given second billing behind Swayze, doesn\\'t have a role that\\'s much more significant. It\\'s an understatement to say that her talent is wasted. I\\'d be curious to know why she agreed to do this film (the answer must have to do with the phrase \"big paycheck\").\\nOn top of all this, as if sitting through this movie isn\\'t a bad enough experience in the first place, the film makers manage to steal away any possible tension through their structuring of the story. We\\'re given the ending to start with then, knowing exactly how everything is going to turn out, we\\'re forced to sit through the details via an extended flashback.\\nFATHER HOOD comes complete with a social message that\\'s as old as Dickens\\' OLIVER TWIST. Foster care in the United States has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as more and more cases of abuse are revealed. While I would support a movie that grapples with the problem sensitively and intelligently, this is not that film. It takes a good- guy, bad-guy approach to the situation and presents it from a decidedly singleminded viewpoint designed to stir the viewer\\'s emotions, not make him or her think about the seriousness of what\\'s going on. In fact, the low quality of FATHER HOOD may actually sabotage the message it\\'s trying to get across.\\nRecently, an Italian film called IL LADRO DI BAMBINI (STOLEN CHILDREN) covered a lot of the same ground. That too was a road film featuring an older, somewhat callous guardian and the two children he was entrusted with. The similarities extend no further than plot structure and character background, because IL LADRO DI BAMBINI is an excellent movie, and viewing it makes the faults of FATHER HOOD seem that much more glaring.\\nThere may not have been many like me, but I was actually impressed by Patrick Swayze\\'s performance in CITY OF JOY. I thought he had taken a big step towards turning around his popcorn-and-soda reputation. But with the release of this example of ugliness, I may have to admit to being mistaken. And \"mistake\" is a key word here, because that\\'s exactly what this entire production is.\\n',\n",
              " \"Starring: Philippe Maron, Edouard Joubeaud, Laurent Monnier, Brigitte de Villepoix, Daniel Dublet Director: Agnes Varda Screenplay: Agnes Varda based on the memoirs of Jacques Demy Music: Joanna Bruzdowicz Released by Sony Pictures Classics In French with English subtitles\\nJACQUOT is a tribute from one lover to another, a project that started out as a collaboration but became a both an homage and a means of saying farewell.\\nFrench film maker Jacques Demy (who is best known for his surrealistic, often-offbeat musicals) died in October 1990, when production on JACQUOT was nearing an end. A filmed chronicle of Demy's childhood memoirs put together by Agnes Varda, his companion of more than thirty years, JACQUOT (the title refers to the young Jacques' nickname) is a look at how the influences of childhood steer a man's creative spirit. During the course of the film, we meet Demy and his friends and family, see his love for the cinema, and observe his first attempts at creating.\\nJACQUOT succeeds in engaging the intellect, but is less triumphant in touching the emotions. Despite the detail and care with which Demy's memories have been committed to film, there is a quality about them that distances the audience. We understand his desires, needs, and the everyday difficulties of his life, but little about this film is stirring. For all that the story is about Jacquot, there's a question of how much of the inner person we get to know. The film seems more concerned with presentation than identification.\\nThe most intriguing and enjoyable parts of the movie are, by far, those that deal with the young Demy's early forays into movie-making. A fair amount of time is spent chronicling the development of a couple of animated shorts that Jacquot shows to his family in a home-made theater. In these scenes, we are given a peek at the creative genius of Demy, and it is through them that JACQUOT attains its goal.\\nIt's always difficult to film someone else's memories without either missing the mark entirely or waxing nostalgic. JACQUOT falls into both traps at times, even as it occasionally hits the mark. Some of the most historically important incidents, such as the Nazi occupation of France and the subsequent bombing raids, fail to bring out the horror and fear that Demy must have felt. The truest moments are often those that seem almost thrown in as an afterthought.\\nWriter/director Agnes Varda uses color to supplement the normal black-and-white in which JACQUOT is presented. Several scenes explode to life in a vivid display of hues, accenting a particular emotion or highlighting a scene. For the most part, it's an effective technique, although one that is possibly a little overused. Also in color are numerous clips from Demy's films. The inclusion of these works very well, showing how incidents from the man's real life impacted the movies he was to make.\\nThe acting is solid from top to bottom, with the three young actors who play the growing Jacquot (Philippe Maron, Edouard Joubeaud, and Laurent Monnier) giving consistent performances that make for a smooth transition from one to the next. The occasional appearances of the real Jacques Demy on-screen lends JACQUOT a bittersweet quality that it might not otherwise have had. In some ways, the scenes with him, lovingly filmed by Ms. Varda, are the most moving of the picture.\\nThe sense of period in JACQUOT is excellent, from the streets and countryside of World War II France to the garage and attic of the Demy house. As mentioned, detail is crucial to this movie and, at least in rolling back the years, such obvious care brings dividends.\\nEven for those who, like me, have never seen anything by Demy, the depiction of the relationship between his memories and work is a source of fascination The clips from eleven films help immeasurably in this respect, yet even without them, there are enough moments in JACQUOT to warrant it a look from those who don't lose patience with this kind of simple, relaxed style.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Starring: Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny, Michelle Forbes Director: Dominic Sena Producers: Steve Golin, Aris McGarry, and Joni Sighvatasson Screenplay: Tim Metcalfe Released by Gramercy Films\\nThere seem to be two ways in which films typically handle serial killer storylines. Either they create messy exploitation flicks with lots of blood and gore, little plot, and even less characterization (the FRIDAY THE 13TH series, for example); or they give a blunt, hard-hitting view of the subject (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, MAN BITES DOG). As with any generalization, there are exceptions, but probably no more than I can count on my fingers. Curiously enough, the latest mass murderer motion picture, called KALIFORNIA, falls somewhere in between the two extremes, and may end up leaving viewers from both camps somewhat dissatisfied.\\nIn the name of research for a book he\\'s writing on serial killers, Brian Kessler (David Duchovny) decides to take his girlfriend Carrie (Michelle Forbes) on a cross-country car trip with stop-offs at famous murder locations. Hoping to find someone to split the costs with (his car gets only eight miles per gallon), Brian advertises on a local college bulletin board. Only one couple answers the ad: Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and Adele Corners (Juliette Lewis). They look flat broke, but Brian still invites them to get in the car, hoping that they can come up with the cash. During the first stages of the journey, Brian gets along with the newcomers, but Carrie is wary, and for good reason--Early is a murderer, and as the distance to California lessens, the body count piles up.\\nIf you can get beyond the huge coincidence that sets up this motion picture, you\\'re in for a chilling ride. Sure, it\\'s a little hard to swallow that a guy writing a book about serial killers should happen to have one in his car, but this is one of only a few instances where an obvious plot device is used. There are other occasions when formulas come into play (such as the ending), but they are not greatly in evidence, and not every situation is resolved in the expected manner.\\nKALIFORNIA is a partially-successful tale about conscience and cold-blooded murder. The film takes the time to develop (with varying degrees of success) all four characters, so that when the truth comes out, events gain a resonance they wouldn\\'t have with the lifeless stock personalities inhabiting the average thriller.\\nThat\\'s not to say that all the characters are likeable, or even fully fleshed out. By the end of the movie, Early Grace is still something of an enigma, although certain elements of his brutal, psychopathic behavior have been made clear. Adele seems too naive to be real, and at times her childlike whining becomes annoying. Brian and Carrie are the easiest to identify with, probably because they\\'re the most \"normal\".\\nThis is no HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. The impact is far less wrenching, but some similarities run deeper than on the most superficial levels. Like HENRY, KALIFORNIA doesn\\'t glamorize its killings, opting more for the visceral than the grotesque. There\\'s also quite a bit of intellectual speculation about what motivates serial killers. While some of that is out-of-place, it keeps the audience constantly questioning why Early sometimes reacts as he does.\\nOf the four principal actors, Brad Pitt gives the least impressive performance, probably because of the nature of his character. Early is all rage and self-righteousness. He\\'s never likeable, and Pitt doesn\\'t put a whole lot of effort into showing any humanity. There are times when Early comes perilously close to a caricature.\\nJuliette Lewis is a little better, but great range isn\\'t required for Adele, either. She\\'s pretty much a simpleminded character who refuses to believe the awful truth about her boyfriend. She shows all the classic symptoms of a victim, some of which are displayed a little too obviously.\\nDavid Duchovny and Michelle Forbes give the strongest performances, and since they\\'re the ones we\\'re supposed to identify with, the realism invested in Brian and Carrie lends added depth to KALIFORNIA. These two are fascinated by killers, but that fascination quickly turns to horror when they realize what they have with them in the back seat.\\nKALIFORNIA is disturbing, and while it doesn\\'t overdo the blood, neither is the violence understated. The basic premise should be enough to keep the meek away--if you have no desire to see a film that follows a serial killer, stay away from KALIFORNIA. Those who don\\'t mind their movies sprinkled with moments of discomfort will find that this picture packs a little more punch than a traditional Hollywood slasher flick.\\n',\n",
              " \"Starring: Christopher Lambert, Loryn Locklin, Kurtwood Smith, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez Director: Stuart Gordan Producers: John Davis and John Flock Screenplay: Steve Feinberg, Troy Neighbors, and Terry Curtis Fox Released by Dimension Films (a division of Miramax)\\nIt's the year 2018 and the population explosion in the United States is out of control. The government has instituted laws that prohibit a woman from having more than one baby, but when the only son of John Brennick (Christopher Lambert) and his wife Karen (Loryn Locklin) dies as an infant, the couple tries for another child--and gets caught. Both of them are sent to the most feared prison in the country: The Fortress, a maximum security establishment from which escape is impossible. To ensure prisoner cooperativeness, each new entry is fitted with a globe in the intestines that, upon disobedience, can cause either pain or death, depending on the nature of the infraction. The Fortress is not a nice place, and its director (Kurtwood Smith) is an emotionless servant of machines.\\nEvery time a movie about the near future presents such a bleak picture of life on Earth, I always hope for a reasonable explanation about how things got so bad. Personally, I don't think that's too much to ask. However, for the most part, the film makers don't agree (apologies to pictures such as the TERMINATOR series), since they could care less about such details. They have a specific situation that needs to be set up to tell their story; everything else is irrelevant. FORTRESS falls right into that category. We can make a few guesses based on clues presented in the film, but even the best picture will be incomplete.\\nThe pattern of this film is unusual. Most movies, no matter how good or bad, have peaks and valleys during the course of their running time. FORTRESS, on the other hand, while starting at a pretty high level, manages a consistent downward trend throughout. It's somewhat out-of-the-ordinary to be able to say that a movie gets uniformly worse with every passing scene. It's only the strength of the beginning that keeps this film from collapsing into the nether regions inhabited by such nightmares as SPLIT SECOND, another science fiction gorefest that takes place in a dreary near-future Earth.\\nThe early minutes of FORTRESS are brimming with promise. Scenes bristle with the potential of interesting characters, strong interaction, and intelligent plot twists. Alas, little or nothing comes of most of these instances; they become a method of cruel teasing, tantalizing the viewer with what might have been. The film degenerates from intriguing to routine to dumb, all in the space of ninety minutes. By the end, it's all formula. The action has become commonplace and the characters flat.\\nThe cast does a reasonable job. Christopher Lambert is probably a better actor than the role deserves, and he occasionally manages to make Jack Brennick believable. Similar praise goes to Loryn Locklin, an attractive blonde who infuses her character with strength of mind and heart. Lincoln Kilpatrick does as much as he can with a secondary part, creating one of the few minor characters that the audiences comes to care about.\\nUltimately, FORTRESS is nonsense, even if the slick futuristic setting tries to put a new spin on the tried and true chase sequences. Once the slant of the script changes from exploring the internal mechanisms of the Fortress to following Brennick's escape plans, the movie is sunk. It's also at this point that significant plot implausibilities start cropping up.\\nOne thing FORTRESS has going for is an impressive visual style--at least for those who can stand a lot of gore. There are exploding stomachs, dismembered bodies, and a great deal of blood--all done quite graphically, for the most part (would you expect anything different from the director of RE-ANIMATOR?). The set design is excellent, and the action scenes are well-paced, if lacking in legitimate surprises.\\nFORTRESS isn't terrible science fiction, but it's far from the top. Hampered by a storyline that never reverses a downward trend, the movie is unable to get on course. Instead of entering the rarefied atmosphere inhabited by such films as ALIENS and the original TERMINATOR, it falls in line with the likes of FREEJACK and ALIEN 3. Not the best company to be in, but it could be worse. Watch SPLIT SECOND and you'll understand how bad things can get in this genre. After that experience, FORTRESS will look like high art.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Well, either CALENDAR GIRL is a blatant attempt to showcase Jason Priestley (of BEVERLY HILLS 90210 fame), or it\\'s an undertaking to make a big-screen copy of the popular 70s sitcom HAPPY DAYS. One might naturally assume the former until a look at the credits reveals the name of Penny Marshall as executive producer--the same Penny Marshall who played Laverne in the HAPPY DAYS spin-off.\\nThe story is simple enough: in 1962, three guys just out of high school (Priestley as Roy, Gabriel Olds as Ned, and Jerry O\\'Connell as Scott) decide to drive to California to meet the girl of their dreams--Marilyn Monroe. Along the way, they encounter numerous routine sit-com situations, a lot of bad dialogue, and a few \"emotional\" moments that will make you want to retch. Eventually, of course, they come face-to-face with Marilyn and learn from her lips the importance of having friends.\\nNot only does this movie seem like HAPPY DAYS, but it has an unfortunate case of WONDER YEARS-itis, with lengthy voiceovers during the first and last ten minutes. If there\\'s something good to be said about the middle portion of this film, at least we don\\'t have to listen to Gabriel Olds talking over all the \"action\".\\nBoy, is this a stupid movie. And I mean really stupid. Anyone who foolishly goes to see CALENDAR GIRL will sit in their seats and wonder whether they\\'re actually seeing what they think they\\'re seeing. For those who can\\'t believe how dumb movies can get, this film is ready to provide a punishing lesson.\\nNot only do our erstwhile heroes manage to meet MM, but one of them gets a date--and subsequently a kiss--from her. Now, I\\'m as willing as the next person to allow a little creative license (or, for this film, a lot), as long as the result is entertaining. In this case, the on-screen idiocy only makes it that much more apparent how implausible the whole situation is. Then the movie further shoots itself in the foot by announcing that Marilyn receives 5000 fan letters each day. Why would these three jerks be singled out of all those others for Marilyn\\'s special attention?\\nOf course, MM isn\\'t the dumb blonde she appears to be. In fact, she\\'s a veritable wellspring of sagely advice. Now, I don\\'t pretend to know what the actress was really like, but I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s nothing like the woman of this film, who obviously has all of life\\'s answers.\\nFar too much of CALENDAR GIRL is devoted to insipid male bonding, none of which amounts to anything, and some of which nearly put me to sleep. The banter is empty, and the characters even emptier. There\\'s a scene in a nudist colony designed to elicit chuckles that garners grimaces instead. Ditto for the scene with the cow. And the nonsensical subplot with the hoodlums chasing after Roy. Where do writers come up with this stuff?\\nBased on his performance in this movie, Jason Priestley couldn\\'t act to save his life. He delivers dialogue with all the passion of a dead leaf, and is clearly on hand just to give the ladies in the audience a hunk to ogle (is there such a thing as a male bimbo?). To that end, he obligingly doffs his shirt. Gabriel Olds, who bears a remarkable resemblance to a young Ron Howard (there\\'s that HAPPY DAYS connection again), and Jerry O\\'Connell won\\'t open any eyes, but at least they manage an occasionally convincing scene.\\nThe best parts of this movie are a series of clips from MM classics like GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and SOME LIKE IT HOT. Their presence is not a reason to see this movie, but they make it apparent how awful the framing story is. Glimpses of these movies make everything around them seem that much more unredeemable. All-in-all CALENDAR GIRL fizzles when it should sizzle, and most potential viewers will find more satisfaction staring at their monthly planner.\\n',\n",
              " \"For those who live in and around Philadelphia, Joey Coyle is a local legend--a dockworker who came to be known and loved by a city of blue-collar toilers who forever root for the underdog (witness their infatuation with several perennial sub-.500 sports teams). Overnight, Coyle went from a nobody to a folkhero by not doing the right thing, an action (or lack thereof) of which everyone seemed to approve. After all, what would you do if, driving down the road one day, you came upon two unattended sacks of money containing 1.2 million dollars?\\nMONEY FOR NOTHING tells a Hollywood version of Coyle's story, judiciously editing his life to make him more appealing to the masses (there is no mention of drug use), and to make the five days following his discovery more entertaining. The film starts with Coyle (John Cusack) discovering the money, inadvertently dropped off the back of an armored car, and follows his life for the next few days as he hides some of the cash, throws some of it away, and tries to launder the rest. Of course, he's also trying to keep his good fortune a secret, because by not returning his find, he's guilty of a felony. Along for the ride in MONEY FOR NOTHING are Benicio Del Tauro as Joey's connection to the underworld, Maury Chaykin as the launderer, Michael Madsen as Laurenzi, the cop on the trail of the missing money, and Debi Mazar as Monica Russo, Joey's girlfriend.\\nBasically, the problem with this film is that it lacks the substance to keep it going for one-hundred minutes. In fact, it's debatable whether there's enough meat in the story for something half that length. Instead of a wistful fantasy about what someone could do with this much money, we get a plodding drama that takes a few stabs at comedy, not many of which work (although there is a nice bit where Maury Chaykin comments that the reason Ben Franklin's is the only smiling face on U.S. currency is because he never became President).\\nDistilled to its essence, the plot of MONEY FOR NOTHING can be described in two or three lines, so it's immediately suspicious that the film makers managed to milk a full-length feature out of the Joey Coyle story. The result is probably no better--or worse--than most prospective viewers would expect. Take away the profanity and the scene with Joey and Monica rolling around naked on a bedspread covered with $100 bills, and you get something that looks suspiciously like a made-for-TV movie.\\nIf there's a reason to see MONEY FOR NOTHING, it's for the supercharged performance of John Cusack, who takes his role to the hilt without ever going over-the-top. Cusack starts out pretty low key, but as the burden of dealing with the money (coupled with a lack of sleep) gets to Joey, the actor brings to the fore a manic quality that makes the eventual outcome of the Coyle case believable. In the end, Joey was acquitted of his crimes on the grounds that he was temporarily insane.\\nMichael Madsen is present with his characteristic unemotional demeanor. While this style has often been a plus (in RESERVOIR DOGS, for example), it doesn't work in MONEY FOR NOTHING, and Madsen's Laurenzi comes off as a non-entity. Debi Mazar, doing her best Marisa Tomei impression, isn't particularly memorable as Monica (a fictional character who functions as a compilation of several real-life people).\\nThere is a tragic, unfilmed epilogue to the Coyle story that those outside of Philadelphia may be unaware of. One month ago, even as he claimed to be eagerly awaiting the release of this movie, Coyle committed suicide. Depression brought on by drug use and the breakup of a relationship were cited as the reasons. These sad, off-screen events make an unimpressive film seem even flatter.\\nThere's nothing horrible about MONEY FOR NOTHING. It has a story to tell, and it accomplishes that aim, albeit in a workmanlike fashion. However, with everything being so straightforward and unremarkable, I can't say it's worth the time or money. And for those Philadelphians going to catch a glimpse of their city on film, they should be warned that even though there are a few shots of familiar places, the bulk of the movie, while supposedly taking place on the streets of the City of Brotherly Love, was actually filmed in Pittsburgh.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Starring: Suzy Amis, Bo Hopkins, Ian McKellen, David Chung Director: Maggie Greenwald Producers: Fred Berner and Brenda Goodman Screenplay: Maggie Greenwald Music: David Mansfield Released by Fine Line Features\\nOnce, Hollywood framed our vision of the Old West as a place of gallantry and bravery, where the good guys and bad guys would shoot it out, and right would always triumph over wrong. Women, when they had parts in these films, had few lines, and rarely broke from the stereotypes of dancing girl or meek, dutiful frontier wife. Lately, however, the images given to us by the film industry have been changing. UNFORGIVEN showed that the line between good and evil is blurred, and Posse made sure that the role of the black cowboy isn\\'t forgotten. Now, THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO comes along to clear up a few more misconceptions.\\nOnce Josephine Monaghan (Suzy Amis) lost her virginity and gave birth to a bastard, her future was ruined. With her past sins hanging over her like a hangman\\'s noose, she has no choice but to flee the constrained, pampered socialite\\'s world she knew in the East, and head West. There she discovers that the best life she can lead as a woman is that of a prostitute, so she makes the bold decision to grab at freedom and independence by masquerading as a man. Whiskers and muscles aren\\'t necessary. The mere appearance of a female as a male in a time when it\\'s \"illegal to dress improper to your sex\" is enough to convince just about everyone.\\nTHE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO follows UNFORGIVEN in presenting a gritty, dirty view of America\\'s Nineteenth Century frontier. The scenery is still nice, but it\\'s hard to appreciate a beautiful vista when an innocent family is getting butchered in the middle of it. There aren\\'t many heroes here; shooting people turns out to be a lot more difficult than plunking tin cans.\\nLoosely based on the true-life story of a woman about whom little is known, the story of LITTLE JO is a masterpiece of detail and intelligence. Maggie Greenwald has done her homework, piecing together an engrossing tale that movies quickly enough to keep the easily- distracted involved, but not so rapidly that it misses the nuances of the situation. Touches of humor are mixed nicely with drama as LITTLE JO explores the entire spectrum of human emotions. And just because Jo has chosen to live life as a man doesn\\'t mean that she can\\'t yearn for her lost femininity.\\nThe focal point of this film is Jo. As played by Suzy Amis, the character is perhaps not perfectly developed, but the actress gets better as the movie unfolds. I was particularly unimpressed with her early scenes (when she\\'s openly female), but after the \"transformation,\" she settled into the role. Amis is not an especially emotive actress, and her Jo is reserved--perhaps occasionally too much so. The most effective scenes are those of quiet emotion, such as when Jo sheds a tear.\\nPhysically, Ms. Amis is not so classically beautiful that she can\\'t be made up to look like a boy. It\\'s amazing how much a change of clothes and a haircut can do. Certainly, the transformation here is far more believable than in ORLANDO. I was never able to accept Tilda Swinton as a man; it\\'s less difficult with Amis. Then again, she\\'s only acting like a man, not actually trying to be one.\\nThe standout actor in LITTLE JO is Bo Hopkins, who gives a boisterous performance as the cursing, gunslinging Frank Badger, a rough man with as good a heart as they come. Hopkins makes Frank come alive, and his relationship with Jo, which deserves far more screen time than it\\'s accorded, is one of the most real and interesting elements of the movie. Would that all the other character interaction was as good.\\nThe last scene belongs in another movie, however. Throughout LITTLE JO, the humor is of the subtle variety, but as the film draws to a close, there is an overt attempt at outright comedy. It works as far as getting laughs, but the presence of this moment somehow cheapens the twilight of an otherwise mostly-effective motion picture. LITTLE JO doesn\\'t need complete closure, and certainly not in the manner by which it is attained.\\nLITTLE JO is successful in capturing the atmosphere of the Old West. Camerawork and musical score deserve credit for this--especially the latter. From the first notes of the opening theme, it\\'s apparent that the choice of David Mansfield was perfect for composer. Rarely has a score so expertly matched the tempo of a film--it becomes a vital part of LITTLE JO without forcing itself upon the audience.\\nIf you like films about the \"new Old West,\" THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO is not to be missed. Even for those who aren\\'t particularly fond of Westerns, this movie still has a lot to offer. Keeping the conventions of the genre to a minimum, it strikes out in bolder directions, reflecting personalities and lifestyles through the eyes of a woman whom everyone accepts as a man. LITTLE JO loses its focus on a number of occasions, but never for very long, and never in such a manner that seriously jeopardizes the viewer\\'s overall enjoyment of Maggie Greenwald\\'s film.\\n',\n",
              " \"Starring: Jesse Bradford, Jeroen Krabbe, Lisa Eichhorn, Adrien Brody, Spalding Gray, Elizabeth McGovern, Karen Allen Director: Steven Soderbergh Producers: Albert Berger, Barbara Maltby, and Ron Yerxa Screenplay: Steven Soderbergh based on the memoirs of A. E. Hotchner Music: Cliff Martinez Released by Gramercy Pictures\\nIn the midst of the Great Depression, in the city of St. Louis, the family of Aaron Kurlander (Jesse Bradford) is falling apart. His little brother has been shipped off to live with an uncle, his sick mother (Lisa Eichhorn) has been admitted to a sanitarium, and his father (Jeroen Krabbe) must go on the road to make money. So Aaron is left on his own in a fleabag hotel, with no money and few friends. Life becomes a struggle for the twelve year old--the hotel wants to evict him and his meager supply of food is running dangerously low--and it's only through his remarkable resourcefulness that he manages to survive.\\nRarely has 1933 St. Louis been so real. Steven Soderbergh (best known for his debut feature SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE) has taken the time and effort necessary to bring the period to life with uncompromising accuracy. Many period pieces give only token acknowledgment to the era in which they take place, but KING OF THE HILL has the Great Depression woven inextricably throughout. Flawless detail is an undeniable asset.\\n1993 has seen movie after movie featuring boys struggling to reach maturity while discovering an identity. AMERICAN HEART, THIS BOY'S LIFE, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER are a few of the better ones, but none is as impressive as KING OF THE HILL, perhaps because none has quite as simple a tale to tell. The film is what it claims to be: a series of interrelated reminiscences about the life of an abandoned child in the midst of one of this nation's most difficult times.\\nThere is much in KING OF THE HILL to enthrall. The characters--even those we don't see much of--are rich, and the situations are, for the most part, entirely believable (I had a little trouble with a scene involving a runaway car, but that was the only sequence that struck a false note). Soderbergh has carefully developed this movie to draw out the drama without resorting to tired plot devices. The fact is, Aaron's story, no matter how plain it might initially seem, is powerful in its simplicity.\\nOf course, to do justice to the plot, an effective young actor was needed to play Aaron. Jesse Bradford's performance is natural and unforced and we never get the sense that he's doing more than reacting to circumstances. The film revolves around Aaron, and Bradford is up to the task, regardless of the complexity of the emotions he is expected to show. Take, for example, the touching, bittersweet relationship that develops between Aaron and a lonely, epileptic girl living down the hall. The resonance of scenes with these two is remarkable.\\nWhile no one else has nearly as much screen time as Bradford, the young actor has established actors supporting him. Foremost are Jeroen Krabbe and Lisa Eichhorn as Aaron's father and mother, each of whom does a fine job with their material. Krabbe comes across as concerned for his children, but painfully distracted by financial difficulties. Eichhorn takes pains to bring sympathetic realism to a small role.\\nAdrien Brody gives an energetic performance as Lester, Aaron's best friend and mentor. Noted monologist Spalding Gray plays an intelligent, frustrated middle-aged man whose relationship with a prostitute (Elizabeth McGovern) Aaron has difficulty categorizing. The two are obviously intimate, yet they appear to have only contempt for one another. McGovern, like Karen Allen as Aaron's teacher, is underused.\\nIt's amazing how something so deceptively uncomplicated can be so effective. The narrative is relatively straightforward; Soderbergh doesn't employ any unusual chronologies. His style is frank, not quirky, and lends itself to a number of powerful images: a starving boy cutting out pictures of food and serving them on a plate, a homeless man waving hello, a puddle of blood-tainted water seeping from underneath a closed door.\\nAs in life, there are a few unanswered questions at the end of KING OF THE HILL, but most of these deal with peripheral issues and in no way detract from the satisfaction imparted by the film. Done with less mastery, this could have been just another run-of-the-mill coming of age story. However, with Soderbergh at the helm (confirming the ability he showed in SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE which some thought might have been a flash in the pan after the disappointing follow-up of KAFKA), this becomes a remarkable odyssey about a resilient young hero who uses both his imagination and his sense of reality to survive.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Starring: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot Director: Tony Scott Producers: Bill Unger, Steve Perry, and Samuel Hadida Screenplay: Quentin Tarantino Music: Hans Zimmer Released by Warner Brothers\\nIt\\'s dangerous to live in Quentin Tarantino\\'s world, as Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) discovers in the explosive TRUE ROMANCE. When Clarence, a loner with a love of low-budget Kung Fu movies, meets Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), a callgirl, it\\'s love at first sight. After a heady night spent in each other\\'s arms and out on a billboard making true confessions, the two decide to get married. After that, at the advise of an Elvis (Val Kilmer) who inhabits his mind, Clarence decides to go to Alabama\\'s pimp (Gary Oldman) and tell him that she\\'s through working. What ensues is a vicious gunfight that leaves two people dead and Clarence with a suitcase of high-value cocaine that everybody--including mob boss Vincenzo Coccoti (Christopher Walken)--want to get their hands on.\\nThere\\'s good news and bad news about TRUE ROMANCE. The good news is that it\\'s written by Quentin Tarantino, the man who made a stunning splash as the writer/director of last year\\'s RESERVOIR DOGS. The bad news is that it isn\\'t directed by him. At the helm instead is Tony Scott, the man who foisted TOP GUN and BEVERLY HILLS COP II on us.\\nLike RESERVOIR DOGS, TRUE ROMANCE is filled with witty dialogue; sharp, macabre humor; and more bullets and blood than one would think likely for the running time. Tarantino\\'s script is loaded with energy and brimming with power. This film is a wild, wild ride whose slower moments are still punctuated by one-liners that only one other screenwriter (David Mamet) seems capable of penning.\\nDirector Scott tries his hardest to turn this film into a typical Hollywood picture suitable for mass consumption. His style lacks punch--he goes for the safe, pretty shots that can be found in almost any action film. It makes one wonder how different this movie might have been had Tarantino helmed it--his methods, which borrow heavily from John Woo and Martin Scorcese, are stark and crisp, and probably would have complemented the script nicely.\\nThe story, however, is too good to be seriously damaged by pedestrian direction. However deeply Scott was involved in the production of this film, his role clearly didn\\'t extend to messing with what Tarantino had written. Those who have seen RESERVOIR DOGS will recognize the similarities, which include a hilarious opening conversation (TRUE ROMANCE\\'s is about Elvis where RESERVOIR DOGS\\' is about Madonna\\'s \"Like a Virgin\") and a multi-sided, drawn-guns showdown.\\nMy favorite scene is a confrontation between mob don Christopher Walken and Clarence\\'s father (Dennis Hopper). Sparks, as well as any number of racial epithets, fly during this visceral and violent tete-a-tete, which includes some of Tarantino\\'s best dialogue and Scott\\'s most proficient direction. Walken has never been more sardonically menacing, and Hopper somehow manages to give an impression of restraint. In a word, this four-minute gem is astounding.\\nFor the most part, the characters are well-written and nicely-developed. My lone quibble is that the romance between Clarence and Alabama seemed forced. Necessary though it is to the plot, it\\'s rushed through too quickly, and I had a hard time accepting how desperately in love these two are supposed to be. While their romantic chemistry is in doubt, they make great partners when it comes to crime, bloodshed, and being on the run.\\nChristian Slater and Patricia Arquette (whose appearance is unbelievably different from that of her last part, in ETHAN FROME) are perfect for these roles, knowing exactly how to put the right amount of energy into Clarence and Alabama without turning them into caricatures. The supporting players are equally good, including Bronson Pinchot as a boot-licking actor who appears to have been included more for comic relief than anything else. Those looking for another link to RESERVOIR DOGS (however slim) will find Chris Penn in the cast.\\nIn many ways, TRUE ROMANCE is an assault on the senses. It works best in a big theater with an impressive sound system. Hans Zimmer\\'s score is on overdrive, and the soundtrack blares rock-and-roll. Somehow, TRUE ROMANCE on video isn\\'t going to be nearly the same experience.\\nThe cautionary warning given for RESERVOIR DOGS applies: those who are disturbed by extreme violence and profanity should stay away. There is no single scene in TRUE ROMANCE as gut-wrenching as the torture in RESERVOIR DOGS, but there are plenty of bullets and lots of blood. The film is graphic in everything it does, and those who prefer sedate motion pictures will not find this one a pleasant experience.\\nTarantino is a hot prospect now, which is good for anyone who enjoys this kind of intense, intelligent, and unapologetically violent thriller. Films such as TRUE ROMANCE don\\'t come along very often--movies unafraid of slipping the bonds of convention in the name of giving the audience something new and exhilarating. For those who aren\\'t bothered by blood and bad language, this is a motion picture to add to 1993\\'s \"must see\" list.\\n']"
