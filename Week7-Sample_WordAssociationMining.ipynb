According to the latest study, 80 million bacteria.</em></div><p>Before germaphobes swear off kissing forever, it should be noted that over 100 trillion microorganisms naturally live in our bodies. Called the microbiome, they are vital for digesting food, synthesizing nutrients and preventing disease.</p><p>The researchers - led by Remco Kort, of TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research) and adviser to the Micropia museum of microbes in the Netherlands - note that a number of different factors are important for shaping our individual microbiota, including genetic relatedness, diet and age.</p><p>But our surroundings - including the individuals with whom we interact - also affect our microbiota. The team notes that our mouths themselves contain over 700 varieties of bacteria, and these are also influenced by those we are closest to - particularly our romantic partners.</p><p>Kort says that as far as he and his colleagues know, \"the exact effects of intimate kissing on the oral microbiota have never been studied. We wanted to find out the extent to which partners share their oral microbiota, and it turns out, the more a couple kiss, the more similar they are.\"</p><h2>Probiotic bacteria in partner\\'s mouth rose threefold after kiss</h2><p>To further study how kissing affects oral microbiota, Kort and his team assessed 21 couples who completed questionnaires on their kissing behavior, including average intimate kiss frequency. </p><p>\"Intimate kissing involves full tongue contact, and saliva exchange appears to be a courtship behavior unique to humans and is common in over 90% of known cultures,\" he says.</p><p>The researchers cite a recent study detailing the importance of kissing in human mating, which proposes that the \"first kiss\" serves to assess a potential mate. They add:</p><blockquote><p>\"Kissing may contribute in mate assessment and bonding via sampling of chemical taste cues in the saliva, including those resulting from the metabolic activity of the bacterial community on the surface of the tongue.\"</p></blockquote><p>After taking swab samples to determine the composition of each individual\\'s oral microbiota on the tongue and in the saliva, the researchers found that when couples intimately kiss at high frequencies, their salivary microbiota become similar. In fact, nine intimate kisses per day was linked to couples having \"significantly shared salivary microbiota.\"</p><p>In order to quantify bacteria transfer, one individual from each couple drank a probiotic beverage with specific varieties of bacteria called <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Bifidobacteria</em>.</p><p><strong>Results showed that after kissing intimately, the quantity of probiotic bacteria in the other individual\\'s saliva rose threefold, and during a 10-second kiss, a total of 80 million bacteria were transferred.</strong></p><p>\"This study indicates that a shared salivary microbiota requires a frequent and recent bacterial exchange and is therefore most pronounced in couples with relatively high intimate kiss frequencies,\" write the authors.</p><h2>Saliva bacteria \\'only transiently present,\\' while tongue bacteria stay long term</h2><p>Another finding from the study reveals an essential role for mechanisms behind selection of oral microbiota - particularly those on the tongue. Though tongue microbiota were more similar among partners than unrelated individuals, the similarity was not altered with more frequent kissing, which is in contrast to microbiota found in saliva.</p><p>The researchers further explain:</p><blockquote><p>Ã¢â\\x82¬Â¨\"Our findings suggest that the shared microbiota among partners is able to proliferate in the oral cavity, but the collective bacteria in the saliva are only transiently present and eventually washed out, while those on the tongue\\'s surface found a true niche, allowing long-term colonization.\"</p></blockquote></p><p>To calculate the number of bacteria that are transferred during a kiss, the researchers used average transfer values and assumptions related to bacterial transfer, kiss contact surface and the value for average volume of saliva.</p><p><em>Medical News Today</em> recently reported on a study that suggested  saliva protects teeth against cavities more than we previously thought.</p><p id=\\'slidebox_trigger\\'><strong>Written by</strong> Marie Ellis<br/></p> \\nA new study examining oral microbiota finds that when couples kiss intimately at high frequencies, their salivary microbiota become similar.\\n',\n",
       " 'Veterinarian and dentist collaborate to help cat through unique dental procedure\\n <p>A Siamese-mix cat named Darryl is recuperating well after receiving a metal prosthesis to correct a palate injury in his mouth, thanks to a unique collaborative dental procedure performed Oct. 29 at the University of Florida Small Animal Hospital.</p><p> The procedure involved affixing a metal prosthesis to the roof of Darryl\\'s mouth to close a gaping hole between his oral and his nasal cavities. Fong Wong, D.D.S., an associate professor of prosthodontics and maxillofacial prosthetics in UF\\'s College of Dentistry, conducted the procedure and was assisted by Amy Stone, D.V.M., Ph.D., a clinical assistant professor in UF\\'s College of Veterinary Medicine.</p><p> This is a procedure Wong routinely performs in human patients with cleft palates or defects after cancer surgery.</p><p> \"This was a different approach than has ever been done before,\" said Stone, who also serves as chief of the veterinary college\\'s primary care and dentistry service. \"We have not had an exact procedure for palate issues that is entirely successful for every species, and Darryl\\'s problem was one likely caused, or at least exacerbated, by injury. There were also other complications, so his situation required something a bit different.\"</p><p> Added Wong, \"Usually medical procedures are first tried in animals, and then, when successful, used in human patients. In this case, it was the animal that benefited from a procedure that is routine in humans but has not been part of routine veterinary medicine.\"</p><p> Darryl was originally rescued from Alachua County Animal Services, where he had been slated for euthanasia, by the Alachua County Humane Society. Even though the massive hole in his hard palate was obvious, Darryl quickly became a staff favorite, said Julie Levy, D.V.M., Ph.D., a professor of shelter medicine at UF who fostered Darryl and later adopted him.</p><p> \"Every bite of food he took was painful, and he had constant nasal infections,\" Levy said. \"Despite struggling to eat and being extremely messy with his food, he was always affectionate and craved attention from staff and volunteers.\"</p><p> But his condition made adoption impossible, so Darryl became a long-term resident of the Humane Society. Levy meanwhile began investigating solutions to his palate problem and transferred the cat to the Maddie\\'s Shelter Medicine Program at UF.</p><p> Various specialists at UF examined Darryl. Katherine Polak, D.V.M., a former UF shelter medicine resident, performed an examination in February. Then Nick Bacon, Vet.M.B., an associate professor of small animal oncology, conducted a biopsy of an oral lesion to rule out cancer. A feeding tube was inserted a few months later, allowing Darryl to gain weight and for his mouth to heal without the trauma of eating and drinking.</p><p> By April, Levy had taken Darryl into her home as her foster pet in order to provide the intensive care she knew was needed to bring him back to health. Various specialists weighed in, or attempted to heal Darryl\\'s palate defect. Soon after Levy contacted UF\\'s College of Dentistry seeking assistance, Wong got involved.</p><p> After performing a separate examination, she proposed a prosthodontic solution. In August, she made a cast of Darryl\\'s mouth and crafted a custom acrylic appliance to cover the defect. The appliance was sutured into place on a trial basis to see if the approach would work in a cat.</p><p> The approach was successful, and on Oct. 29, Darryl\\'s permanent metal prosthesis was installed. His feeding tube was removed two days after the procedure and he was able to eat normally for the first time in more than a year.</p><p>\"He is doing great,\" Levy said. \"Many thanks to the entire team who pitched in to help this lovely cat.\"</p> \\nA Siamese-mix cat named Darryl is recuperating well after receiving a metal prosthesis to correct a palate injury in his mouth, thanks to a unique collaborative dental procedure performed Oct.\\n',\n",

But now it seems they play an active role in defending against pathogens and keeping the human microbiome healthy.</p><p>First author Erica Shapiro Frenkel, of Harvard University, and principal investigator Katharina Ribbeck, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in Cambridge, MA, report their findings in the journal <em>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</em>. </p><p>Frenkel says their findings suggest boosting the body\\'s natural defences might be a better way to prevent tooth decay than relying on external agents like sealants and fluoride treatments.</p><p><strong>The researchers found that salivary mucins do not alter levels of <em>S. mutans</em> nor kill the bacteria over 24 hours.

As the bacterium grows under the protection of the biofilm, organic acid byproducts of its metabolism attack the tooth enamel, causing cavities.</p><p>For their study, the researchers focused on how the salivary mucin MUC5B affects the ability of <em>S.mutans</em> to attach to teeth and form a biofilm. These are the two key steps necessary for cavities to form, Frenkel explains.</p> <p><strong>The investigation grew out of previous work looking at gastric mucins in pigs that protected against lung pathogens. The researchers wondered if salivary mucins might also play a protective role.</strong></p>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Frenkel says common diseases like cystic fibrosis, ulcerative colitis and asthma have been linked to problems with mucin production.</p><p>\"There is increasing evidence that mucins aren\\'t just part of the mucus for structure or physical protection, but that they play an active role in protecting the host from pathogens and maintaining a healthy microbial environment,\" she adds.</p><p>Prof. Ribbeck says this kind of research is important because it changes scientists\\' views on host-microbe interactions:</p><blockquote><p>\"It is generating a paradigm shift from the textbook view of mucus as a simple catchall filter for particles, towards the understanding that mucus is a sophisticated bioactive material with powerful abilities to manipulate microbial behavior.\"</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, <em>Medical News Today</em> recently learned that  Roman Britons had less <a href=\"/articles/167727.php\" title=\"What is gum disease?

The surprise findings provide further evidence that modern habits like smoking can be damaging to oral health.</p><p>Gum disease, also known as periodontitis, is the result of a chronic inflammatory response to the build-up of dental plaque. Whilst much of the population lives with mild gum disease, factors such as tobacco smoking or medical conditions like diabetes can trigger more severe chronic periodontitis, which can lead to the loss of teeth.</p><p>The study, published in the British Dental Journal, examined 303 skulls from a Romano-British burial ground in Poundbury, Dorset for evidence of dental disease. Only 5% of the skulls showed signs of moderate to severe gum disease, compared to today\\'s population of which around 15-30% of adults have chronic progressive periodontitis.</p><p>However many of the Roman skulls, which form part of the collections in the Palaeontology department of the Natural History Museum, showed signs of infections and abscesses, and half had caries (tooth decay). The Poundbury population also showed extensive tooth wear from a young age, as would be expected from a diet rich in coarse grains and cereals at the time.</p><p>The Poundbury cemetery community, genetically similar to modern European populations, was made up of countryside dwellers as well as a Romanised urban population. This was a non-smoking population and likely to have had very low levels of diabetes mellitus, two factors that are known to greatly increase the risk of gum disease in modern populations. Among the people who survived infancy, childhood illnesses and malnutrition into adulthood, the peak age at death appears to have been in their 40s. Infectious diseases are thought to have been a common cause of death at that time.</p><p>Professor Francis Hughes from the Dental Institute at King\\'s College London and lead author of the study said: \"We were very struck by the finding that severe gum disease appeared to be much less common in the Roman British population than in modern humans, despite the fact that they did not use toothbrushes or visit dentists as we do today. Gum disease has been found in our ancestors, including in mummified remains in Egypt, and was alluded to in writings by the Babylonians, Assyrians and Sumerians as well as the early Chinese.\"</p><p>Theya Molleson, co-author of the study from the Natural History Museum said: \"This study shows a major deterioration in oral health between Roman times and modern England.

For the first time, Salvatore Sauro, Professor in Biomaterials and Minimally Invasive Dentistry at University CEU Cardenal Herrera Valencia (Spain), in collaboration with international researchers from Finland, Brazil, United States and United Kingdom, has demonstrated that zoledronates (zoledronic acid) in combination with bioactive ion-releasing resin-based adhesive systems can be applied in restorative dentistry as an innovative strategy to reduce the degradation of dentin collagen and enhance remineralisation processes at the resin-dentine interface.</p><p>Zoledronic acid is a class of medications called bisphosphonates. It works by slowing bone breakdown, increasing bone density and decreasing the amount of calcium released from the bones into the blood. Zoledronic acid is used to prevent or treat osteoporosis in women who have undergone menopause. It is also used to treat osteoporosis in men, and to prevent or treat osteoporosis in individuals who are taking glucocorticoids. This drug can be prescribed for the treatment of the Paget's disease of bone or high levels of calcium in the blood that may be caused by certain types of cancer. Zoledronic acid is applied in cancer chemotherapy to treat bone damage caused by multiple or by cancer that began in another part of the body but has spread to the bones. However, it is not a cancer chemotherapy, and it will not slow or stop the spread of cancer. For the first time Zoledronic acid has been tested in combination with bioactive resin-based adhesive systems and applied in restorative dentistry as an innovative strategy to reduce the degradation of dentin collagen and promote enhanced remineralisation at the resin-dentine interface.</p><p><strong>Remineralisation properties</strong></p><p>The research performed by Professor Sauro and his team showed that the remineralisation properties of bioactive ion-releasing resin-based materials can be potentiated when they are employed in combination with biomimetic phosphoproteins' analogues of dentine mineralization such as Zoledronic acid. It is well known that resin-hybridized dentin can be affected by the proteolytic action of host-derived matrix metalloproteinases present within the dentine matrix, also in the absence of bacterial enzymes.</p><p>However, collagen degradation within incompletely infiltrated hybrid layers may be prevented by biomimetic remineralization of the denuded collagen fibrils within the resin-dentine bonding interface.</p><p>The research team which produced this scientific data was leaded by Professor Sauro in collaboration with professor Arzu Tezvergil-Mutluay and Dr. Roda Seseogullari Dirihan from the University of Turku (Finland); Dr. Victor Feitosa, from the Federal University of CearÃ\\x83Â¡ (Brazil); Professors Franklin Tay and David Pashley, from Georgia Health Sciences University (United States); Professor Tim Watson from King's College London Dental Institute at Guy's Hospital (United Kingdom).</p><p><strong>Research line</strong></p><p>Salvatore Sauro, Professor of Biomaterials and Minimally Invasive Dentistry at University CEU Cardenal Herrera (CEU-UCH) in Valencia (Spain), has been working on an impressive research program where the main objective is the development of bioactive restorative and/or preventive materials with potential regenerative properties for dental tissues.</p><p>Professor Sauro has more than 15 years of experience in dental adhesion, preventive and biomaterials research with more than 60 scientific articles in international peer-review journals, 1 international patent and 1 Brazilian patent.

They say that simple measures such as encouraging better brushing and flossing could provide the same marginal performance gains as expensive physical therapies.</p><p>The statement came out of the April 2014 Oral Health and Performance in Sport collaboration led by Professor Ian Needleman of the UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Professor Fares Haddad of the Institute of Sport Exercise and Health (ISEH). This resulted in a conference held at UCL where experts in oral health and sports medicine met with sporting associations and elite athletes to produce a consensus on how to improve oral health in sport.</p><p>A UCL survey at the London 2012 Olympic Games found that 18% of athletes said that their oral health had a negative impact on their performance and 46.5% had not been to the dentist in the past year. The latest consensus statement aims to address such issues by embedding oral health into the wider culture of sports healthcare and health promotion.</p><p>\"Oral health could be an easy win for athletes, as the oral conditions that can affect performance are all easily preventable,\" says Professor Needleman. \"Professional athletes and their teams spend a lot of time and money on ways to marginally improving performance, as this can make all the difference in elite sports. Simple strategies to prevent oral health problems can offer marginal performance gains that require little to no additional time or money. Things like better tooth brushing techniques and higher fluoride toothpastes could prevent the toothache and associated sleeping and training difficulties that can make the crucial difference between gold and silver.\"The intense dietary and training pressures on athletes could put them at high risk of oral health problems for many reasons. Saliva helps to protect teeth from decay and erosion, so dehydration and drying of the mouth could increase the risk of oral health problems. The amount of energy that athletes need for training often means they have high-carbohydrate diets and regularly use sugary, acidic energy drinks. These may contribute to decay and erosion in athletes\\' teeth.</p><p>\"We do not want to demonise energy drinks and are not saying that athletes shouldn\\'t be using them,\" says Professor Needleman. \"However, people should be aware of the risks to oral health and can take simple measures to mitigate these. For example, water or hypotonic drinks are likely to be more suitable for simple hydration, and spit don\\'t rinse after tooth brushing. For sports where athletes need a lot of energy drinks, high fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses should be seriously considered.\"</p><p>The authors also recommend regular dental appointments to identify and address oral health issues before they can affect performance. Olympic athletes are all supposed to have a dental check-up within 12 months of the competition but, as the previous survey found, almost half of the athletes London 2012 had not. The consensus statement calls for national sport funders and policy organisations to take the lead in ensuring that oral health is regularly assessed, especially pre-season, to allow for personalisation of prevention plans and early treatment of any disease.Dr Mike Loosemoore, Lead Consultant in Sport and Exercise Medicine at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, says: \"I think this is an important consensus statement. My experience of instituting a programme of improving oral health in elite sportsman has had a very positive effect.\"</p> \\nPoor oral health affecting athletes\\' general health and performance shows \\'no signs of improvement\\' and must be remedied, say a group of UCL-led health experts and sporting bodies.\\n',\n",
       " 'Combatting periodontal pathogens\\n <p>A total 12 million Germans suffer from periodontitis. If the inflammation remains untreated, this could lead to tooth loss. However, it is also suspected of triggering many other diseases, like cardiopulmonary diseases. Researchers are studying the interactions, and developing compounds to combat the causative agents.</p><p>If the gums bleed when brushing one\\'s teeth or biting into an apple, this condition could be pointing to periodontitis -an inflammatory disease of the periodontal apparatus. Bacterial plaque attacks the bones; over time, the tooth could loosen. Leaving the disease untreated could lead to tooth loss. Periodontitis, also known as periodontal disease or \"shrinking gums,\" is also a source of disease for the entire body: If the to some extent highly aggressive bacteria make their way into the blood circulation, they could cause additional damage. Medical studies highlight the interaction between periodontal disease triggers and various diseases like cardiopulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Evidence shows that the affected patient has an elevated risk of cardiovascular constriction, as well as Alzheimer\\'s.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, around 60 percent of all adults suffer from gum inflammation and are in need of treatment - which is a rather high figure. In the EU project known as \"TRIGGER,\" eleven European research institutions from nine countries are dedicated to the study of the widespread disease. They investigate the influence of periodontitis pathogens on the aforementioned diseases. The goal is to explain and prove the connections between periodontitis and other inflammatory diseases, and that effective oral hygiene and treatment of the periodontal disease can improve the status of one\\'s general health. One particular task of the joint project was taken over by the Department of Drug Design and Target Validation of the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI: the researchers for the satellite office of the IZI in Halle/Saale aim to develop substances that can be used to treat pathogenic oral germs effectively. To support their efforts, the Halle-based team is entitled to one-tenth of the total research grant of EUR 7.8 million. The Group\\'s expertise lies in identifying pathological mechanisms at the protein level and optimizing substances based on these insights.</p><p>\"We are searching for the active ingredients to battle the highly toxic bacteria known as Porphyromonas gingivalis. This aggressive lead pathogen resides in the gingival pockets of the gums. It is responsible for gingivitis - the gum disease of the mouth that can lead to the development of periodontitis,\" explains Dr. Hans-Ulrich Demuth, head and initiator of the project group in Halle. The expert in proteins headed up an \"active ingredient research\" work group for a long time at the Martin-Luther-UniversitÃ\\x83Â¤t Halle, and later at the Leibnitz Institute for Natural Substances Research in Jena. During his tenure as managing director of Probiodrug AG, the biotechnology company, his team designed a treatment plan for age-related diabetes that is currently on the market today.</p><p>Porphyromonas gingivalis lives off of the breakdown of collagen in the oral cavity. The bacteria destroys the gum\\'s connective tissue by activating a protein-degrading enzyme - and specifically before it is released into the oral cavity. In order to trigger this mechanism, Porphyromonas gingivalis uses a special enzyme: the bacterial glutaminylcyclase, which is involved with protein maturation. The Halle-based researchers characterized this enzyme years ago in mammals, and discovered new traits. \"It plays an essential role in the immune-overreaction to disease patterns, and is involved in inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, and Alzheimer\\'s disease, for instance. There is obviously a fundamental connection between certain bacterial infections and various inflammatory diseases that has yet to be explained. We presume that human glutaminyl-cyclase, for instance, forms a variant of the amyloid-beta peptide in Alzheimer\\'s patients that is especially deleterious to nerve cells. A treatment principle based on this to combat Alzheimer\\'s meanwhile is in clinical trials. With gingivitis, the blocking of the bacterial key enzyme could cause starvation of the Porphyromonas gingivalis pathogen,\" explains Professor Demuth. The biochemist and his team are therefore searching for an inhibitor substance that minimizes the enzyme\\'s action.</p><p>The Halle-based group has already seen initial successes. From a package of 20 substances, they could filter out a few highly effective substances, which have inhibited growth of the germ Porphyromonas gingivalis in the cell culture model by 95 percent. Animal-based experiments commence next. Yet before a compound against periodontal disease hits the markets, a series of measures must transpire first. The first manner of business is optimizing the substances before they can be put to clinical trials, in which form and quantity the active ingredient can be administered. \"This is a protracted process. But in order to combat periodontitis, an adequately good oral hygiene by itself is not enough. Here, one additionally must resort to medicinal interventions and thus also prevent Porphyromonas gingivalis from triggering other inflammatory diseases,\" Demuth states.</p> \\nA total 12 million Germans suffer from periodontitis.

From there, they spread to the brain at their will. In addition, in older individuals, the blood vessels tend to enlarge and become leaky.\"</p></blockquote><p><p>\"The published work confirmed <em>P. gingivalis</em> placed in the mouths of mice finds its way to the brain once gum disease becomes established first,\" Dr.  Singhrao concludes. \"Furthermore, our hypothesis is strengthened by the recent results demonstrating that the chemicals released by the brain\\'s immune system in response to <em>P. gingivalis</em> reaching the brain \\'inadvertently\\' damage functional neurons in the area of the brain related to memory.\"</p></p><h2>Pancreatic cancer</h2><p>A research team from Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, MA, were the first to report strong evidence on a link between gum disease and pancreatic cancer, back in 2007.</p><div class=\"photobox_right\" style=\\'max-width:350px;\\' ><img src=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/images/articles/283/283649/illustration-showing-the-location-of-the-pancreas.jpg\" alt=\"illustration showing the location of the pancreas\"><br><em>Researchers are unable to prove whether the periodontitis bacteria are a cause or result of pancreatic cancer - current research can only prove that the two are linked.</em></div><p>The type of gum inflammation associated with pancreatic cancer in the study was periodontitis, which affects the tissue that support the teeth and can cause loss of bone around the base of the teeth. </p><p>The other main kind of gum disease - gingivitis; where the tissue around the teeth becomes inflamed - was not linked to increased cancer risk.

The TDF clinics are designed for and financially accessible to people with developmental disabilities in Massachusetts, and many caregivers and patients have developed long-term relationships with dental professionals at the clinics.

Even though comprehensive dental benefits are required in Medicaid, it is much more likely that preschool-aged children enrolled in Medicaid will receive medical care than dental care. Therefore, 46 state Medicaid programs have enacted policies to reimburse medical primary care providers for administering early childhood tooth decay preventive services since 2000. These services may include topical fluoride application, parental counseling, mouth exams and an overall assessment for risk of tooth decay. The policy in Florida, which covers children ages 6 months to 42 months, was implemented on April 15, 2008 and reimburses providers $27 for these services. The policy in Texas, which covers children ages 6 months to 35 months, was implemented on Sept. 1, 2008 and reimburses providers $34.16 for these services. Topical fluoride application, combined with parental counseling, has been shown to reduce tooth decay by up to 50 percent in high-risk children.</p><p> \"We are fully committed to increasing the number of Medicaid-enrolled children who receive preventive dental services,\" said Beth Kidder, assistant deputy secretary for Medicaid Operations at the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration in Tallahassee. \"We are pleased that our policy change is expanding good oral health care to more children.\"</p><p> The researchers examined reimbursement data on more than 1 million children in Florida and almost 2.1 million children in Texas, for a total sample size of more than 3.1 million.

Even after controlling for factors that could influence the findings, such as age and length of Medicaid enrollment, the children covered under the new policy were 20 percent more likely in Florida and 25 percent more likely in Texas to receive oral health preventive services than before the policy was enacted when compared with another group of children who were too old to be covered under this specific policy.</p><p> This analysis, which was published in the journal Health Services Research in July, has far-reaching public health implications given that Medicaid covers more than one-third of all children in the U.S. Led by Herndon, the multidisciplinary team that completed the analysis included W.

To tackle the growing problem of tooth decay, researchers from University College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, both in the UK, say the World Health Organization\\'s recommendation of a maximum of 10% total daily calories from free sugar should be reduced to 5%, with 3% as a target.</header><div class=\"photobox_right\" style=\\'max-width:350px;\\' ><img src=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/images/articles/282/282553/pile-of-sugar.jpg\" alt=\"pile of sugar\"><br><em>Among children, the researchers found that moving from consuming almost no sugar to 5% of total daily calories doubled the rate of tooth decay. This rose with every increase in sugar intake.</em></div><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines free sugar as any monosaccharides and disaccharides that a manufacturer, cook or consumer adds to foods. Sugars that are naturally present in honey, syrup and fruit juices are also classed as free sugars.</p><p><strong>It is well known that sugar consumption is a leading cause of dental caries. Bacteria in the mouth can feed off of certain sugars, producing plaque containing acids that remove minerals from the outer enamel of the tooth.</strong></p><p>Unless cleaned well, the acids continue to destroy the tooth to the point where an individual can experience severe toothache or an abscess - a bacterial infection that causes a collection of pus.</p><p>But the researchers note: \"Despite the use of fluoride and improvements in preventive dentistry, the burden of dental caries remains unacceptably high worldwide, particularly when, in addition to the traditional focus on childhood caries, the caries burden in adults is considered.\" They put this down to sugar intake.</p><p>In 2002, WHO set guidelines recommending that daily consumption of free sugars should make up a maximum of 10% of an individual\\'s total energy intake - the equivalent to 50 g of free sugars per day. However, WHO state the daily target should be half of this at 5%, or 25 g of free sugars per day.</p><p>In March, <em>Medical News Today</em> revealed that WHO had issued draft guidelines calling for a  reduction of daily sugar intake to 5% of total daily calories in an attempt to tackle tooth decay, as well as obesity.</p><p>In this latest study, published in the journal <em>BMC Public Health</em>, the researchers support this proposed move, but say the 5% figure should represent the maximum daily free sugar intake, while the target should be 3%.</p><h2>The prevalence of tooth decay as a result of sugar intake</h2><p>The team\\'s recommendations come from an analysis of public health records from different countries. They compared dental health and sugar consumption over time among large populations of adults and children.</p><p><strong>They found that adults had a significantly higher incidence of tooth decay than children, and this incidence soared with any sugar consumption over 0% of total daily calories. But even among children, the team found that moving from consuming almost no sugar to 5% of total daily calories doubled the rate of tooth decay. This rose with every increase in sugar intake.</strong></p><p>\"Tooth decay is a serious problem worldwide and reducing sugar intake makes a huge difference,\" says study author Aubrey Sheiham, of the Department of Epidemiology & Public Health at University College London. \"Data from Japan were particularly revealing, as the population had no access to sugar during or shortly after the Second World War. We found that decay was hugely reduced during this time, but then increased as they began to import sugar again.\"</p><p>Furthermore, the team found that in Nigeria, only 2% of people at all ages had tooth decay when they consumed almost no sugar - approximately 2 g per day. \"This is in stark contrast to the US, where 92% of adults have experienced tooth decay,\" adds Sheiham.</p><p>Commenting on their results, the researchers say:</p><blockquote><p>\"These findings imply that public health goals need to set sugar intakes ideally at <3% energy intake per day with <5% energy intake as a pragmatic goal, even when fluoride is widely used. Adult as well as children\\'s caries burdens should define the new criteria for developing goals for sugar intake.\"</p></blockquote><h2>Other strategies to combat the prevalence of tooth decay</h2><p>As well as their call for the target daily sugar intake to be reduced to 3%, the team sets out a number of other recommendations they believe should be considered in the fight against tooth decay.</p><p>They say that sugar-sweetened treats and fruit juices should not be marketed at children. Instead, there should be focus on the harm they can cause.</p><p>Furthermore, they say vending machines containing confectionary and sugary drinks should be removed from areas that are supported or controlled by central or local governments. </p><p>\"We are not talking draconian policies to \\'ban\\' such sugar-rich products, which are available elsewhere,\" says co-author Prof. Phillip James, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, \"but no publicly-supported establishment should be contributing to the expensive problems of dental caries, obesity and diabetes.\"</p><p>They note that there should also be a review of food labeling, and new food labels should state a food\\'s sugar content as \"high\" if it is above 2.5%.</p><p>Last year, <em>Medical News Today</em> reported on a study by researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Reading in the UK, in which they claimed a sugary drink tax of 20% could reduce obesity.</p><p>In this latest study, the team says a tax should be developed to increase the cost of all food and drinks that are high in sugar. Prof. James says:</p><blockquote><p>\"This would be simplest as a tax on sugar as a mass commodity, since taxing individual foods depending on their sugar content is an enormously complex administrative process. The retail price of sugary drinks and sugar-rich foods needs to increase by at least 20% to have a reasonable effect on consumer demand, so this means a major tax on sugars as a commodity. The level will depend on expert analyses but my guess is that a 100% tax might be required.\"</p></blockquote><p>Earlier this year, a study published in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em> claimed a high added sugar intake increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.</p><p id=\\'slidebox_trigger\\'><strong>Written by</strong> Honor Whiteman<br/></p> \\nA study claims the WHO recommendation of a maximum of 10% total daily calories from free sugar should be halved to 5%, with 3% as a target, to tackle rising rates of tooth decay.\\n',\n",

Fibroblasts themselves produce proteins including collagen and fibronectin that connect in a complex matrix that is found in the skin, the intestines and other tissues in the body.</p><p>The researchers used this fibroblast-created matrix to test how cells migrate through a three-dimensional structure. The matrix is crosslinked, meaning its fibers are resistant to bending and flexing as the cells move through.</p><p>Studies of fibroblasts on two-dimensional surfaces indicated that the most typical form of movement involved protrusions called lamellipodia, created by the polymerization of the protein actin into fibers that push the cell membrane forward. In 2012, however, Petrie and Yamada showed that when fibroblasts migrate they can switch to a different movement strategy when placed in a three-dimensional matrix, using blunt protrusions called lobopodia.</p><p>What the researchers did not know was how these lobopodia were formed. Suspecting they might be generated from increased intracellular pressure, the team used sophisticated microelectrodes to measure the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid inside the cell. They found that the pressure was significantly higher in cells moving in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix compared to cells moving along a two-dimensional surface or in a three-dimensional matrix that wasn\\'t cross linked like the fibroblast-derived matrix.</p><p>To drill down further and see how the pressure was distributed within the cell moving in a three-dimensional matrix, they measured pressure from in front of and behind the nucleus. Cells moving using lobopodia have elevated pressure in front of the nucleus but not behind it, generating energy to propel the cell forward. Using live-cell confocal microscopy, they observed that the nucleus could be pulled forward, away from the rear of the cell, with the nucleus dividing the cell into low-pressure and high-pressure compartments.</p><p>\"When a cell is in the matrix, the nucleus tends to be at the back of the cell, and the cell body is very tubular in shape,\" Petrie said. \"It really looked like a piston.\"</p><p>They found that the nucleus is actually pulled forward by the actin filaments that connect the nucleus to the front of the cell. This movement \"pressurizes\" the cell. The scientists were also able to identify the protein components responsible for moving the nuclear piston, including actomyosin, vimentin and nesprin.</p><p>\"The pressure itself is what pushes the plasma membrane,\" Petrie said.</p><p>Because this only happened to cells moving in the three-dimensional cell-created matrix and not cells moving in other substrates, the researchers note that the cells must be sensing their physical environment to determine what type of movement to use.</p><p>This type of cell migration might be common in other tissues of the body, the researchers noted. When they took chondrocytes from knee cartilage and myofibroblasts from intestinal tissue and placed them in the matrix, those cells used the same type of lobopodia-driven motion.</p><p>The discovery could have implications for understanding diseases such as cancer as well, because cancerous cells tend to move in distinct ways from normal cells.</p><p>\"It might give us leverage to find out what is unique about cancer cells so we can target them therapeutically and not affect normal cells,\" Petrie said.</p><p>Importantly, these findings could have broader relevance to other biological systems where living cells are enmeshed within and surrounded by an extracellular matrix, such as in biofilms, which are associated with many human infectious diseases.</p><p>\"This work illustrates how the physical structure of the matrix can influence cellular properties to govern biological function,\" Koo said. \"We are now applying these fascinating principles to further understand how biofilm matrix modulates bacterial virulence to cause oral diseases, such as dental caries.\"</p> \\nFor decades, researchers have used petri dishes to study cell movement.

A solid-head design allows for less growth of bacteria and bristles should be soft and made of nylon,\" Morris said. \"It is also important to disinfect and to let your toothbrush dry between uses.

It is published in the OnlineFirst portion of the IADR/AADR <em>Journal of Dental Research (JDR).</em></p><p>The researchers of this study investigated population trends in edentulism among U.S. adults at least 15 years of age by creating time-series data from five national cross-sectional health surveys: 1957-1958 (n=100,000 adults); 1971-1975 (n=14,655 adults); 1988-1998 (n=18,011 adults); 1999-2002 (12,336 adults) and 2009-2012 (n=10,522 adults). Birth cohort analysis was used to isolate age and cohort effects. Geographic and sociodemographic variation in prevalence was investigated using a sixth U.S. survey of 432,519 adults conducted in 2010. Prevalence through 2050 was projected using age-cohort regression models with simulation of prediction intervals.</p><p>Across the five-decade observation period, edentulism prevalence declined from 18.9% in 1957-1958 to 4.9% in 2009-2012. The single most influential determinant of the decline was the passing of generations born before the 1940s, whose rate of edentulism incidence (5-6% per decade of age) far exceeded later cohorts (1-3% per decade of age). High income households experienced a greater relative decline, although a smaller absolute decline, than low income households.</p><p>By 2010, edentulism was a rare condition in high-income households and it had contracted geographically to states with disproportionately high poverty. With the passing of generations born in the mid-20th century, the rate of decline in edentulism is projected to slow, reaching 2.6% (95% prediction limits [PL]:2.1%, 3.1%) by 2050. The continuing decline will be offset only partially by population growth and population aging, such that the predicted number of edentulous people in 2050 (8.6 million, 95%PL: 6.8 million, 10.3 million) will be 30% lower than the 12.2 million edentulous people in 2010.</p><p>\"While it\\'s encouraging to know that this study by Dr. Gary Slade illustrates a steep decline in U.S. edentulism over the past five decades, these health gains in absolute terms have not been distributed equally,\" said AADR President Timothy DeRouen. \"Additional public health measures must be taken to reduce tooth loss in low-income populations.\"</p> \\n\\n',\n",

Shah</em></div><p>This type of coated scaffold could offer a dramatic improvement over the current standard for treating bone injuries, which involves transplanting bone from another part of the patient\\'s body - a painful process that does not always supply enough bone. Patients with severe bone injuries, such as soldiers wounded in battle; people who suffer from congenital bone defects, such as craniomaxillofacial disorders; and patients in need of bone augmentation prior to insertion of dental implants could benefit from the new tissue scaffold, the researchers say.</p><p>\"It\\'s been a truly challenging medical problem, and we have tried to provide one way to address that problem,\" says Nisarg Shah, a recent PhD recipient and lead author of the paper, which appears in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> this week.</p><p>Paula Hammond, the David H. Koch Professor in Engineering and a member of MIT\\'s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Department of Chemical Engineering, is the paper\\'s senior author.

As part of the natural wound-healing cascade, PDGF is one of the first factors released immediately following a bone injury, such as a fracture. After PDGF appears, other factors, including BMP-2, help to create the right environment for bone regeneration by recruiting cells that can produce bone and forming a supportive structure, including blood vessels.</p><p>Efforts to treat bone injury with these growth factors have been hindered by the inability to effectively deliver them in a controlled manner. When very large quantities of growth factors are delivered too quickly, they are rapidly cleared from the treatment site - so they have reduced impact on tissue repair, and can also induce unwanted side effects.</p><p>\"You want the growth factor to be released very slowly and with nanogram or microgram quantities, not milligram quantities,\" Hammond says. \"You want to recruit these native adult stem cells we have in our bone marrow to go to the site of injury and then generate bone around the scaffold, and you want to generate a vascular system to go with it.\"</p><p>This process takes time, so ideally the growth factors would be released slowly over several days or weeks. To achieve this, the MIT team created a very thin, porous scaffold sheet coated with layers of PDGF and BMP. Using a technique called layer-by-layer assembly, they first coated the sheet with about 40 layers of BMP-2; on top of that are another 40 layers of PDGF. This allowed PDGF to be released more quickly, along with a more sustained BMP-2 release, mimicking aspects of natural healing.</p><p>\"This is a major advantage for tissue engineering for bones because the release of the signaling proteins has to be slow and it has to be scheduled,\" says Nicholas Kotov, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Michigan who was not part of the research team.</p><p>The scaffold sheet is about 0.1 millimeter thick; once the growth-factor coatings are applied, scaffolds can be cut from the sheet on demand, and in the appropriate size for implantation into a bone injury or defect.</p><p><strong>Effective repair</strong></p><p>The researchers tested the scaffold in rats with a skull defect large enough - 8 millimeters in diameter - that it could not heal on its own. After the scaffold was implanted, growth factors were released at different rates. PDGF, released during the first few days after implantation, helped initiate the wound-healing cascade and mobilize different precursor cells to the site of the wound. These cells are responsible for forming new tissue, including blood vessels, supportive vascular structures, and bone.</p><p>BMP, released more slowly, then induced some of these immature cells to become osteoblasts, which produce bone. When both growth factors were used together, these cells generated a layer of bone, as soon as two weeks after surgery, that was indistinguishable from natural bone in its appearance and mechanical properties, the researchers say.</p><p>\"Using this combination allows us to not only have accelerated proliferation first, but also facilitates laying down some vascular tissue, which provides a route for both the stem cells and the precursor osteoblasts and other players to get in and do their jobs. You end up with a very uniform healed system,\" Hammond says.</p><p>Another advantage of this approach is that the scaffold is biodegradable and breaks down inside the body within a few weeks. The scaffold material, a polymer called PLGA, is widely used in medical treatment and can be tuned to disintegrate at a specific rate so the researchers can design it to last only as long as needed.</p><p>Hammond\\'s team has filed a patent based on this work and now aims to begin testing the system in larger animals in hopes of eventually moving it into clinical trials.</p> \\nMIT chemical engineers have devised a new implantable tissue scaffold coated with bone growth factors that are released slowly over a few weeks.\\n',\n",

What\\'s their DNA? And from that we can infer what these bacteria might be doing for us.\"</p><p>Whiteley\\'s lab started by isolating RNA from the plaque samples collected. Study co-author Keith Turner, a postdoctoral researcher in Whiteley\\'s lab, explained. \"RNA, for those who know about computers, is kind of like the RAM (random access memory), the working memory of the cell.\" The RNA sample acts like a memory image or \\'core dump\\' to reveal the processes of the as-yet unknown bacterium it came from. And unfortunately, said Turner, you can\\'t get a full picture of the activity because there are so many molecules in the sample.</p><p>\"But what you do,\" Turner explained, \"is get what you can and profile it by sequencing, using some recent technological advances. Then it\\'s essentially a search problem.\" </p><p> Turner searched a metagenomic database, essentially a vast genetic clearing house sampled from the environment instead of lab grown. He looked for matches at the NIH\\'s Human Microbiome Project. A match told what bacterium a gene came from in the sample, and Turner tallied each match. \"The more it\\'s thinking about a certain process, the more it seems to be important to it,\" said Turner. \"The shotgun approach, as you might imagine, is very computationally intensive, which is why we turned to TACC for some of these problems.\"</p><p>How big were these problems?</p><p>Turner and colleagues chose 60 different species of bacteria to represent the total community. More than 160,000 genes were analyzed, yielding 28 to 85 million reads of RNA snippets, including about 17 million mRNA reads for each sample.</p><p> His main findings show that bacteria act differently when one is healthy compared to when diseased. \"The main thing that they change when they go from health to disease is that they change their metabolism,\" Whiteley said. In other words, a species of bacteria that ate one thing, fructose for example, can switch to a different kind of sugar to feed on if diseased.</p><p>\"The kind of thing that might have taken a desktop computer a week, two weeks to run we can run at TACC in just a couple of hours,\" Turner said. \"Stampede allows us to use 6,400 desktop computers, all at the same time. There are a lot of problems in biology that can benefit from the supercomputing approach.\"</p><p>Whiteley found periodontitis interesting because it\\'s one of the most prevalent diseases on the planet. \"It\\'s an interesting disease, because the same bacteria that are in your mouth when you\\'re healthy are the same ones, more or less when you\\'re sick,\" he said.</p><p>\"What our study says is that it doesn\\'t really matter what bacteria you have, because the communities are acting very similarly,\" Whiteley explained. \"So a healthy community has this metabolism, no matter what the members are. And a diseased community has a very different metabolism, no matter what the members are. It\\'s this conservation of a metabolic community. \"</p><p>Whiteley compared what\\'s happening under our gums to an ecosystem in the African savannah. The interactions among \\'animals\\' is key. \"You have lions, and you have leopards, and wildebeest, and all of these animals that are there. If you look at it as a whole community, it kind of makes sense. But if you were to only take a one-acre plot out of the African savannah and look at it, it may not make sense because there may not be a lion in that one acre. So trying to understand interactions, you need to take a much larger, bigger context. And that\\'s what this study did,\" Whiteley explained.</p><p> According to science results from the Human Microbiome Project, a shift to more harmful bacteria in the community is linked to wide-ranging diseases such as periodontitis, diabetes, and Crohn\\'s disease.</p><p>Whiteley said his research can help people by helping to develop biomarkers that predict if someone\\'s going to get sick. \"Can you actually come up with a very quick way to assess the behavior of the community quickly and say, are you on the progression of moving from health to disease, and then provide some sort of preventative measure when you get there,\" Whiteley explained.</p><p>Pathogenic bacterial communities that rewired themselves to be harmful might also be rewired for health. It\\'s possible in theory, anyway, according to Whiteley.</p><p>\"You can manipulate bacterial populations numerically very easily. You feed them something else.

In this study we found an unacceptably inconsistent array of advice from different sources.</p><p>\"Dental associations need to be consistent about what method to recommend, based on how effective the method is. Most worryingly, the methods recommended by dental associations are not the same as the best ones mentioned in dental textbooks. There is no evidence to suggest that complicated techniques are any better than a simple gentle scrub.\"</p><p>The most commonly-recommended technique involves gently jiggling the brush back and forth in small motions, with the intention of shaking loose any food particles, plaque and bacteria. However, no large-scale studies have ever shown this method to be any more effective than basic scrubbing.</p><p>\"Brush gently with a simple horizontal scrubbing motion, with the brush at a forty-five degree angle to get to the dental plaque,\" Professor Sheiham advises. \"To avoid brushing too hard, hold the brush with a pencil grip rather than a fist. This simple method is perfectly effective at keeping your gums healthy.</p><p>\"There is little point in brushing after eating sweets or sugary drinks to prevent tooth decay. It takes bacteria from food about two minutes to start producing acid, so if you brush your teeth a few minutes after eating sugary foods, the acid will have damaged the enamel.\"</p><p>The conflicting messages given by different organisations highlight the need for research into how effective different brushing methods are. At present, the expert advice in the guidelines, \\'The scientific basis of dental health education\\', recommend a simple scrubbing technique as it is easy to learn and there is no evidence to justify a more complicated method.</p><p>\"The wide range of recommendations we found is likely due to the lack of strong evidence suggesting that one method is conclusively better than another,\" says lead author Dr John Wainwright, who carried out the study at UCL and is now a practising dentist. \"I advise my patients to focus their brushing on areas where plaque is most likely to collect - the biting surfaces and where the teeth and gums meet - and to use a gentle scrubbing motion. All too frequently I am asked why the method I am describing differs from how previous dentists have taught them in the past.</p><p>\"What I feel we need is better research into what the easiest to learn, most effective and safest way to brush is.

And as human activity that generates lead pollution varies around the world, so do the profiles of lead isotopes in the environment.</header><div class=\"photobox_right\" style=\\'max-width:350px;\\' ><img src=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/images/articles/280/280727/mouth.jpg\" alt=\"Mouth\"><br><em>Researchers say our teeth lock in the isotope composition of lead in our surrounding environment, information which could be used to help police solve cold cases.</em></div><p>George Kamenov, of the University of Florida, and Brian L. Gulson, of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, write about the discovery in the journal <em>Science of the Total Environment</em>.</p><p>In their paper, they describe how they used high-precision lead isotope data from modern and historical human teeth to reveal where they came from.</p><p>Dr. Kamenov, a geology researcher, says the finding could help the police solve cold cases. For example, testing the teeth in a badly decomposed body could help focus the investigation in a particular geographic area:</p><p><strong>\"We can use this pollution signal to figure out where these people came from,\" he explains.</strong></p><p>Lead is an element that exists in four forms called isotopes. The amount of each isotope differs according to where it is found in the world in rocks, in soil and in ores. So samples of lead taken from different parts of the world will have slightly different proportions of the four isotopes - their lead isotope profiles will differ.</p><p>The lead isotope profile of a region also reflects the different types of human activity that have caused lead to be released into the environment. This accumulates in children\\'s bodies as they grow and inhale it from the air and ingest it from contact with soil.</p><h2>Tooth enamel locks in lead from childhood exposure</h2><p>Unlike bone, which is always regenerating, tooth enamel develops during childhood and stays there, locking in the unique profile of lead isotopes and preserving them, as Dr. Kamenov explains:</p><blockquote><p>\"When you grow up, you record the signal of the local environment. If you move somewhere else, your isotope will be distinct from the local population.\"</p></blockquote><p>Also, say the authors,  because different teeth develop at different times in childhood, they can show if a person moved around in their childhood.</p><p><strong>For instance, the enamel in first molar teeth has finished forming by the age of 3, and reveals where that person was from birth through toddler years.</strong></p><p>Enamel in incisor and canine teeth begins to form later and finishes around age 5, giving clues about residency in early childhood, and third molar enamel does not finish until age 8, giving clues about later childhood years.</p><h2>Lead profiles can distinguish modern from historical teeth</h2><p>Analyzing lead profiles in teeth can also pinpoint a period - helping to distinguish between modern and historical teeth. Because of mining and the use of lead in gasoline, there is a clear distinction in the type of lead in the environment in modern times compared with earlier centuries.</p><p>The authors suggest their discovery may also help archaeologists identify early European bodies in New World areas.</p><p>\"You can go back in time, look at archaeological sites and try to reconstruct human migration,\" Dr. Kamenov suggests.</p><p><strong>He and his colleague also show how the tooth of the modern American is like no other elsewhere in the world. Whereas the lead profiles for regions such as South America overlap with Europe, the US mining industry has used ores in a unique way, giving rise to a distinct profile of lead in the environment.</strong></p><p>\"Lead isotopes can be used to easily identify foreigners in the USA, as modern USA teeth are distinct from any other region of the world. By analogy, USA individuals can be identified virtually in any other region of the world,\" they note.</p><p>\"What\\'s in the environment goes into your body,\" says Dr. Kamenov.</p><p>Meanwhile, researchers in Canada are working on a new forensic tool that detects ethnicity and gender in a single hair. A recent study showed the cutting edge technique produced 100% accurate results faster than current DNA analysis.</p><p id=\\'slidebox_trigger\\'><strong>Written by</strong> Catharine Paddock PhD<br/></p> \\nBy analyzing the profile of lead isotopes in teeth, it is possible to identify the place of origin of an individual and help police solve cold cases, say researchers.\\n',\n",

       " 'Stem cells from nerves form teeth\\n <p>Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered that stem cells inside the soft tissues of the tooth come from an unexpected source, namely nerves. These findings are now being published in the journal Nature and contribute to brand new knowledge of how teeth are formed, how they grow and how they are able to self-repair.</p><p>Our health and quality of life is closely linked to our dental health. With age, our teeth become more susceptible to infection, wear and damage, and it is important for the health services to help people maintain good dental health. It was previously known that the living, soft part of the tooth, or the pulp, in addition to connective tissues, blood vessels and nerves also contains a small reserve of stem cells. These stem cells are capable of repairing the tooth when it has been damaged by assisting the reformation of both hard and soft tooth tissue. Researchers have long been discussing the origin of these stem cells. By studying the teeth of mice, the researchers behind this new study have been able to map the fate of individual cells.</p><p>\"We have identified a previously unknown type of stem cells that surprisingly enough belong to the nerves of the tooth; these are nerves that would normally be associated with the tooth\\'s extreme sensitivity to pain,\" says Kaj Fried at the Department of Neuroscience, one of the head researchers responsible for the study.</p><p>The researchers discovered that young cells, which at first are part of the neural support cells, or the glial cells, leave the nerves at an early stage of the foetal development. The cells change their identity and become both connective tissues in the tooth pulp and odontoblasts, i.e., the cells that produce the hard dentin underneath the enamel. Today we do not have the possibility of growing new teeth in adults, but the discovery of this new type of stem cells is an important step towards the knowledge and technology that is required to make it a future possibility.</p><p>\"The fact that stem cells are available inside the nerves is highly significant, and this is in no way unique for the tooth. Our results indicate that peripheral nerves, which are found basically everywhere, may function as important stem cell reserves.  From such reserves, multipotent stem cells can depart from the nerves and contribute to the healing and reformation of tissues in different parts of the body,\" says Igor Adameyko at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, who has headed the study along with Kaj Fried.</p> \\nResearchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered that stem cells inside the soft tissues of the tooth come from an unexpected source, namely nerves.\\n',\n",

Bioengineered stem cell teeth could challenge the use of artificial dental implants.</p><p> Worldwide we spend more on dentistry than we do on many medical treatments. Everyone in the developed world will receive dental treatment at some point and it doesn't come cheap - current implants to replace broken or decayed teeth cost around Ã\\x82Â£2000. Screwed directly into the jaw, they fail to reproduce the normal connection between teeth and bone and might work loose in less than 30 years.</p><p> Scientists are developing an innovative procedure that would use cells from adult patients to grow full functioning teeth in situ. The treatment could be working in mice in 5 years according to exhibit leader Professor Paul Sharpe, Dickinson Professor of Craniofacial Biology at King's College London Dental Institute.</p><p> Teeth can be grown from embryonic cells but Professor Sharpe says a treatment using only adult cells and growth-stimulating chemical factors that are already regulated for use in treatment, has a much better chance of ever making it to market.</p><p> 'It's very easy to grow teeth from embryonic cells in a lab environment but if it's going to cost Ã\\x82Â£50,000 per implant it will never make it into clinical use,' says Professor Sharpe. Embryonic cells are surrounded by ethical controversy and could not be collected in the numbers necessary for approved large scale treatment in patients. Adult cells are a more accessible option and, if the patient's own cells are used, they could also negate the need for a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs to avoid rejection.</p><p> 'We're focused on an end point for patients and to replace current implants, a stem cell therapy needs to be price competitive. Patients are not going to pay for a treatment that costs 10 times as much as an implant. Realistically they would probably pay for a treatment that costs twice or three times as much because a bioengineered tooth would last forever. But to reach that point we need to go back to basics using only growth factors which are already regulated, and we need to use accessible cells from adults - that's where the challenge lies'.</p><p> To grow a new tooth requires two types of cell, epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. One of these types of cells must send instructions to the other cell population to begin creating the different cell types and tissues needed in teeth.</p><p> Professor Sharpe's team have already shown that epithelial cells collected from adult patients' gum tissues during routine dental surgery can respond to instructions from embryonic mesenchymal cells to growth of teeth. The team is now searching for a source of mesenchymal cells from adults that will trigger the same responses.</p><p> One source might be stem cells in adult bone marrow or teeth themselves, but these cells lose their ability to produce other types of tissue after 24 hours in culture. Professor Sharpe is working with Dr Abigail Tucker to figure out how to reawaken the properties of the cells to grow diverse tissue and unlock their ability to grow new teeth.</p><p> Dr Tucker studies the replacement of teeth in the animal kingdom. Sharks and snakes grow teeth on a conveyer belt, constantly replacing those that are broken or fall out. New teeth grow in the dental lamina - a tissue packed with stem cells which die off in humans as soon as adult teeth come through.</p><p> Dr Tucker studies the signals from cells in the stem cell rich dental lamina, to see how they trigger the formation of new teeth in these animals. Her work on signalling might help Professor Sharpe replicate the signals and perhaps revive the potency of adult cells to grow new teeth.</p><p> 'We've shown in the lab that you can use epithelial adult cells with tooth-inducing mesenchymal cells from embryos and we've shown that embryonic epithelial cells with mesenchymal adult cells can grow new teeth. Now we need to combine adult epithelial and adult mesenchymal cells. It's one of the last pieces of the puzzle'.</p> \\nPioneering techniques aiming to grow new teeth from a patient's own stem cells will be on display at the Royal Society's Summer Science Exhibition which opens to the public on 1 July 2014.\\n\",\n",

       " 'New insight into oral microbiome offered by computational technique\\n <p>Scientists have applied a new technique to comprehensively analyze the human oral microbiome - providing greater knowledge of the diversity of the bacteria in the mouth. For the first-time, scientists can provide high-resolution bacterial classification at the sub-species level. This work will enable researchers to more closely examine the role of bacterial communities in health and disease.</p><p>The study, \"Oligotyping analysis of the human oral microbiome,\" will be published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> and available online the week of June 23rd. For this project, Gary Borisy, Senior Research Investigator, Department of Microbiology at Forsyth collaborated with Drs. A. Murat Eren and Jessica L. Mark Welch at Marine Biological Laboratory and Dr. Susan M. Huse at Brown University.</p><p>The human body, including the mouth, is home to a wide range of microbial organisms. In fact, there are ten times more bacterial cells in the human body than human cells. Bacteria in nature live in complex, multi-species communities in which bacterial cells in close proximity to each other can exchange metabolic products and signals. \"Knowing who is living there and who their neighbors are is essential to understanding how they work together,\" said Borisy. \"We now have the opportunity to truly classify the bacteria and know what the distinct species are within these communities.\"</p><p><strong>Overview of Study</strong></p><p>The Human Microbiome Project, an effort of the National Institutes of Health, produced a census of bacterial populations from 18 body sites in more than 200 healthy individuals. DNA in these samples was sequenced from the gene in bacteria that encodes ribosomal RNA, called the 16S rRNA gene, or 16S. The 16S gene serves as a \"barcode\" for the identity of the organism. Although the Human Microbiome Project was groundbreaking in scope, a big problem has been interpreting the enormous numbers of barcodes obtained and distinguishing real barcodes from errors. A general practice has been to collect similar barcodes together and put them into bins. But this risks lumping together species that shouldn\\'t be lumped, such as pathogens and non-pathogens. \"The Post Office knows my name and address, but imagine,\" said Borisy, \"how it would respond to receiving letters (without addresses) for Borisi, Barisy, Borisey or Borisky. Are these misspellings or real differences? That\\'s a big problem facing the barcoders.\"</p><p>A new high-resolution method termed oligotyping overcomes this problem by evaluating individual positions in the barcode using Shannon entropy to identify the most information rich nucleotide positions, which then define oligotypes. The team has applied this method to comprehensively analyze the oral microbiome.</p><p>Using Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene sequence data for the nine sites in the oral cavity, the team identified more than 300 oligotypes. They associated these oligotypes with species-level taxon names by comparison with the Human Oral Microbiome Database. The scientists discovered closely related oligotypes, differing sometimes by as little as a single nucleotide that showed dramatically different distributions among oral sites and among individuals. Many oligotypes were site-specialists. Some were preferentially located in plaque, others in gums or the cheek, and some were characteristic of throat, tonsils, tongue, palate, and saliva. The differing habitat distributions of closely related oligotypes reveal a level of ecological and functional biodiversity not previously recognized. The researchers conclude that the Shannon entropy approach of oligotyping has the capacity to analyze entire microbiomes, discriminate between closely related but distinct taxa and, in combination with habitat analysis, provide deep insight into the microbial communities in health and disease.</p> \\nScientists have applied a new technique to comprehensively analyze the human oral microbiome - providing greater knowledge of the diversity of the bacteria in the mouth.\\n',\n",

       " 'Immune system selectively disarmed by gum disease bacteria\\n <p>The human body is comprised of roughly 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells. In healthy people, these bacteria are typically harmless and often helpful, keeping disease-causing microbes at bay. But, when disturbances knock these bacterial populations out of balance, illnesses can arise. Periodontitis, a severe form of gum disease, is one example.</p><p>In a new study, University of Pennsylvania researchers show that bacteria responsible for many cases of periodontitis cause this imbalance, known as dysbiosis, with a sophisticated, two-prong manipulation of the human immune system.</p><p>Their findings, reported in the journal <em>Cell Host & Microbe</em>, lay out the mechanism, revealing that the periodontal bacterium <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis</em> acts on two molecular pathways to simultaneously block immune cells\\' killing ability while preserving the cells\\' ability to cause inflammation. The selective strategy protects \"bystander\" gum bacteria from immune system clearance, promoting dysbiosis and leading to the bone loss and inflammation that characterizes periodontitis. At the same time, breakdown products produced by inflammation provide essential nutrients that \"feed\" the dysbiotic microbial community. The result is a vicious cycle in which inflammation and dysbiosis reinforce one another, exacerbating periodontitis.</p><p>George Hajishengallis, a professor in the Penn School of Dental Medicine\\'s Department of Microbiology, was the senior author on the paper, collaborating with co-senior author John Lambris, the Dr. Ralph and Sallie Weaver Professor of Research Medicine in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine in Penn\\'s Perelman School of Medicine. Collaborators included Tomoki Maekawa and Toshiharu Abe of Penn Dental Medicine.</p><p>Work by Hajishengallis\\'s group and collaborators had previously identified <em>P. gingivalis</em> as a \"keystone pathogen.\" Drawing an analogy from the field of ecology, in which a species such as a grizzly bear is thought of as a keystone species because of the influence it has over a number of other species in the community, the idea suggests that, although <em>P. gingivalis</em> may be relatively few in number in the mouth, their presence exerts an outsized pull on the overall microbial ecosystem. Indeed, the team has shown that, although <em>P. gingivalis</em> is responsible for instigating the process that leads to periodontitis, it can\\'t cause the disease by itself.</p><p>\"Scientists are beginning to suspect that keystone pathogens might be playing a role in irritable bowel disease, colon cancer and other inflammatory diseases,\" Hajishengallis said. \"They\\'re bugs that can\\'t mediate the disease on their own; they need other, normally non-pathogenic bacteria to cause the inflammation.\"</p><p>In this study, they wanted to more fully understand the molecules involved in the process by which <em>P. gingivalis</em> caused disease.</p><p>\"We asked the question, how could bacteria evade killing without shutting off inflammation, which they need to obtain their food,\" Hajishengallis said.</p><p>The researchers focused on neutrophils, which shoulder the bulk of responsibility of responding to periodontal insults. Based on the findings of previous studies, they examined the role of two protein receptors: C5aR and Toll-like receptor-2, or TLR2.</p><p>Inoculating mice with <em>P. gingivalis</em>, they found that animals that lacked either of these receptors as well as animals that were treated with drugs that blocked these receptors had lower levels of bacteria than untreated, normal mice. Blocking either of these receptors on human neutrophils in culture also significantly enhanced the cells\\' ability to kill the bacteria. Microscopy revealed that <em>P. gingivalis</em> causes TLR2 and C5aR to physically come together.</p><p>\"These findings suggest that there is some crosstalk between TLR2 and C5aR,\" Hajishengallis said. \"Without either one, the bacteria weren\\'t as effective at colonizing the gums.\"</p><p>Further experiments in mice and in cultured human neutrophils helped the researchers identify additional elements of how <em>P. gingivalis</em> operates to subvert the immune system. They found that the TLR2-C5aR crosstalk leads to degradation of the protein MyD88, which normally helps clear infection. And in a separate pathway from MyD88, they discovered that <em>P. gingivalis</em> activates the enzyme PI3K through C5aR-TLR2 crosstalk, promoting inflammation and inhibiting neutrophils\\' ability to phagocytose, or \"eat,\" invading bacteria.</p><p>Inhibiting the activity of either PI3K or a molecule that acted upstream of PI3K called Mal restored the neutrophils\\' ability to clear <em>P. gingivalis</em> from the gums.</p><p>\"<em>P. gingivalis</em> uses this connection between C5aR and TLR2 to disarm and dissociate the MyD88 pathway, which normally protects the host from infection, from the proinflammatory and immune-evasive pathway mediated by Mal and PI3K,\" Hajishengallis said.</p><p>Not only does the team\\'s discovery open up new targets for periodontitis treatment, it also suggests a bacterial strategy that could be at play in other diseases involving dysbiosis.</p> \\nThe human body is comprised of roughly 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells.\\n',\n",
       " 'Better communication is key to overall oral health\\n <p>Many people delay and even skip visits to the dentist due to anxiety and fear. Now University of Florida researchers have discovered that difficulty understanding and using health information, a skill known as health literacy, is another key reason they avoid the dentist - a phenomenon that contributes to poor oral health in rural, low-income and vulnerable U.S. populations.</p><p> While race, gender, education, financial status and access to dental care are typically reported as risk factors for poor oral health, a team of UF Health researchers has demonstrated that a lack of health literacy also significantly contributes to poor oral health. The team, led by Yi Guo, Ph.D., assistant professor in the department of health outcomes and policy, included researchers from the UF Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health. They used a complex statistical model to evaluate patient-dentist communication and gain insight into the role that health literacy plays in the quality of the oral health in rural, low-income populations.</p><p> \"Oral health is extremely important as it has been linked with major health problems, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease,\" said Guo, who also noted that the burden of oral disease falls heaviest on rural, low-income Americans. \"Our goal is to identify factors that could potentially help promote better oral health in our rural communities.\"</p><p> The UF Health team was able to trace issues with health literacy to a breakdown in patient-dentist communication and therefore to less frequent dental visits. If dentists fail to communicate with their patients in ways that are easy to understand or if patients have difficulty understanding their dentists, patients may be less likely to visit the dentist regularly. This lack of preventive oral care ultimately leads to poorer oral health.</p><p> To improve communication, dentists should shift away from using technical language, the researchers suggest. In addition, oral health education materials also should be rewritten to reflect a sixth-grade reading level, and dentists should provide materials for patients to keep for future reference.</p><p>\"The take-home message from this study is that the dental team needs to make the patient the center of communication, and then tailor the oral health information so it is understandable and relevant to that patient,\" said Henrietta Logan, Ph.D., a UF professor emeritus in the department of community dentistry and behavioral science, who contributed to the study.</p><p> \"Carefully listening to the patient and his or her concerns is a necessary first step in fixing the communication disconnect between patients and the dental teams. Only then do we have a chance to break the ongoing cycle of low health literacy and poor oral health,\" she said.</p><p> Another long-term strategy to improve oral health literacy is to provide navigators or guides in dentists\\' offices to assist patients by helping them fill out forms, obtain information, and understand dentists\\' recommendations, as well as by answering their questions, researchers said. The navigators would help patients become more familiar with health care and the health care system, incrementally increasing their health literacy overall.</p><p> The findings, which will be published in \"Health Literacy: A Pathway to Better Oral Health\" in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>, were based on two waves of targeted telephone surveys with 1,799 people in several north central Florida counties, including Alachua, Bradford, Union, Jefferson, Leon and Gadsden.</p> \\nMany people delay and even skip visits to the dentist due to anxiety and fear.\\n',\n",

The five-year survival rate of 40% in the U.S. is one of the lowest of the major cancers, and it has not improved in the past 40 years.  More people die each year in the U.S. from oral cancer than from melanoma, cervical, or ovarian cancer.  Worldwide, the incidence of oral cancer is increasing, particularly among young people and women, with an estimated 350,000 - 400,000 new cases diagnosed each year.</p><p>\"The major risk factors, tobacco and alcohol use, alone cannot explain the changes in incidence, because oral cancer also commonly occurs in patients without a history of tobacco or alcohol exposure,\" said Dr. Brian Schmidt, professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery and director of the Bluestone Center for Clinical Research at the NYU College of Dentistry (NYUCD).</p><p>Changes in the microbial community are commonly associated with dental diseases such as periodontal disease, which is most likely a poly-microbial disease characterized by outgrowth of certain pathologic organisms, and chronic periodontitis has been reported to be a risk factor for oral premalignant lesions and cancers.</p><p>\"We know that other cancers, including gallbladder, colon, lung and prostate, have been associated with particular bacterial infections, so we hypothesized that shifts in the composition of the normal oral cavity microbiome could be promoters or causes of oral cancer,\" said Dr. Albertson.</p><p>Drs. Schmidt and Albertson and their team profiled cancers and anatomically matched contralateral normal tissue from the same patient by sequencing 16S rDNA hypervariable region amplicons. The team\\'s findings, \"Changes in abundance of oral microbiota associated with oral cancer,\" published on-line in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em> (June 2014), begin to develop a framework for exploiting the oral microbiome for monitoring oral cancer development, progression and recurrence.</p><p>In cancer samples from both a discovery (n=5) and a subsequent confirmation cohort (n=10), abundance of Firmicutes (especially Streptococcus) and Actinobacteria (especially Rothia) was significantly decreased relative to contralateral normal samples from the same patient. Significant decreases in abundance of these phyla were observed for pre-cancers, but not when comparing samples from contralateral sites (tongue and floor of mouth) from healthy individuals. Using differences in abundance of the genera Actinomyces, Rothia, Streptococcus and Fusobacterium, the team was able to separate most cancer samples from pre-cancer and normal samples.</p><p>\"The oral cavity offers a relatively unique opportunity to screen at risk individuals for (oral) cancer, because the lesions can be seen, and as we found, the shift in the microbiome of the cancer and pre-\\'cancer lesions compared to anatomically matched clinically normal tissue from the same individual can be detected in non-invasively collected swab samples.\" said Dr. Schmidt.</p><p>Non-invasively sampling the microbiome of oral lesions and corresponding normal tissue opens the possibility to not only detect cancer-associated changes at one time point, but the relative stability of the adult oral microbiome also offers the opportunity to monitor shifts in bacterial communities over time.</p><p>\"Here we observed changes in the microbiome, which, in future larger studies, may be confirmed as a potential biomarker of oral cancers or pre-cancers, and may even have utility to discriminate patients with lymph node metastases,\" notes Dr. Albertson. \"In addition, there are other challenges in clinical management of oral cancers that would benefit from better diagnostic tools.\"</p><p>Oral cancer patients are also at risk of second primary cancers and recurrences. The microbiome may provide signatures that can be used as a biomarker for monitoring field changes associated with the high rate of second primary oral cancers and recurrences.

This study compared the association between the provider of preventive services (nDPCP, dentist or both) to Medicaid-enrolled children before their third birthday and subsequent dental caries-related treatment (CRT) and CRT payment. The complete study by researchers A.M. Kranz, R.G. Rozier, J.S. Preisser, S.C. Stearns, M. Weinberger and J.Y. Lee is published in the OnlineFirst portion of the<em> IADR/AADR Journal of Dental Research</em> (JDR).</p><p>The researchers conducted a retrospective study of young children enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid during 2000 to 2006. The annual number of CRT and CRT payments per child between the ages of three to five years of age were estimated with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression and a hurdle model, respectively. Models were adjusted for relevant child- and county-level characteristics and used propensity score weighting to address observed confounding.</p><p>The researchers examined 41,453 children with more than one preventive oral health visit from an nDPCP, dentist or both before their third birthday. Unadjusted annual mean CRT and payments were lowest among children who had only nDPCP visits (CRT = 0.87, payment = $172) and higher among children with only dentist visits (CRT = 1.48, payment = $234), and both nDPCP and dentist visits (CRT = 1.52, payment = $273). Adjusted results indicated that children who had dentist visits (with or without nDPCP visits) had significantly more CRT and higher CRT payments per year during the ages of three and four than children who had only nDPCP visits. However, these differences attenuated each year after age three.</p><p>Due to children\\'s increased opportunity to receive multiple visits in medical offices during well-child visits, preventive oral health services provided by nDPCPs may lead to a greater reduction in CRT than dentist visits alone. This study supports guidelines and reimbursement policies that allow preventive dental visits based on individual needs.</p><p>\"On behalf of the <em>Journal of Dental Research</em>, I thank the authors for conducting this retrospective study of young children enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid,\" said AADR President Timothy DeRouen. \"This paper emphasizes the needs-based approaches to clinical care and demonstrates a good opportunity for dentists and physicians to collaborate on oral health for the benefit of children.\"</p> \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Knowledge and confidence helps dentists care for scleroderma patients\\n <p>A survey of dentists in Massachusetts suggests that their confidence in treating patients with scleroderma may be related to their familiarity with the autoimmune disease. Dentists who reported feeling knowledgeable about scleroderma felt more prepared to provide care to patients with scleroderma, when compared to peers who did not feel as knowledgeable. Providing education to dentists may improve patient satisfaction and access to care, while simultaneously increasing dentists\\' knowledge and comfort.</p><p>Background: Scleroderma, derived from the Greek words for \"hard skin,\" is a group of autoimmune diseases that are characterized by thickened and tightened skin, as well as dry mouth. Patients with scleroderma typically have shrunken mouths and stiffer hands, making it difficult to brush and floss their teeth. Patients with scleroderma have difficulty stretching their mouths open, making it difficult to receive care and for dentists and dental hygienists to provide care. This may contribute to the higher risk of oral diseases among dental patients who have scleroderma.</p><p>An unpublished national survey of 350 scleroderma patients in 2011 by students and faculty at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) found that people with scleroderma have difficulty obtaining professional oral health care.</p><p>To expand on the results of the unpublished survey, David Leader, D.M.D., M.P.H., an associate professor at TUSDM, and colleagues developed a new survey in an effort to understand dentists\\' knowledge of scleroderma and their attitudes toward treating patients with the diseases.</p><p>Methodology: An online survey was sent to the 4,465 members of the Massachusetts Dental Society, representing 80 percent of practicing dentists in the state, and was completed by 269 (6 percent) of dentists. The survey contained a series of questions to determine dentists\\' knowledge of scleroderma and their confidence or ability to treat patients who have scleroderma.</p><p>Results: The survey results revealed that the 71 percent of dentists who felt prepared to treat patients with scleroderma were more likely to be knowledgeable about the indicators of the disease, such as dry mouth, and thickening of the skin which makes it difficult for patients to open their mouths for dental care. In contrast, 28 percent of responding Massachusetts dentists did not feel qualified to treat scleroderma patients, and 51 percent of the respondents were concerned that a lack of knowledge regarding how to care for an individual with scleroderma may cause harm to the patient. Additionally, approximately 96 percent of dentists reported that they would like to learn more about scleroderma. The results indicate that awareness of protocols and complications associated with treating patients with scleroderma may help improve their oral health care.</p><p>Discussion: \"In this case, dentists may be overly concerned about their patients\\' needs, because they feel that they do not know enough to treat someone with scleroderma, and thus fear causing harm. That said, if dentists have access to knowledge about how to accommodate patients with scleroderma, they can confidently provide care,\" said first author David Leader.</p> \\nA survey of dentists in Massachusetts suggests that their confidence in treating patients with scleroderma may be related to their familiarity with the autoimmune disease.\\n',\n",

Translating the results of research using this approach to the clinic involves numerous hurdles - both regulatory and practical.</p><p>But the laser-based method the Harvard-led team is working on should be much easier to translate to the clinic, as Prof. Mooney explains:</p> <blockquote><p>\"Our treatment modality does not introduce anything new to the body, and lasers are routinely used in medicine and dentistry, so the barriers to clinical translation are low. It would be a substantial advance in the field if we can regenerate teeth rather than replace them.\"</p></blockquote><p>The work began when lead author and dentist Dr. Praveen Arany  drilled holes in the molars of laboratory rats.

Because the teeth are \"non-shedding surfaces,\" microorganisms are able to adhere to them for long periods of time, which can lead to the formation of biofilms and dental plaque.</p><p>Forming a symbiotic relationship within dental plaque, bacteria such as streptococci or lactobacilli are able to produce organic acids in high levels following the fermentation of dietary sugars.

Three teams (220 athletes) were randomly assigned to wear custom-made mouthguards, and three teams (192 athletes) wore standard OTC mouthguards of their own choosing. All players wore the same style of football helmet.</p><p>According to the study, 8.3 percent of athletes in the OTC mouthguard group suffered MTBI/concussion injuries. For those with custom-made mouthguards, however, the rate was only 3.6 percent.</p><p>Many variables contribute to MTBI/concussion injuries, and mouthguards - whose primary function is protecting the teeth - cannot completely prevent them from occurring. Previous studies have theorized that mouthguards can reduce concussion risk, however, because they help absorb shock, stabilize the head and neck, and limit movement caused by a direct hit to the jaw.</p><p>Mouthguard thickness also has been shown to be a factor that contributes to the level of protection. The average thickness of the custom-made mouthguards in this study was 3.50 millimeters, while the average thickness of the OTC mouthguards was only 1.65 millimeters.</p><p>\"Although more research on this topic is needed, our study shows the value of a custom-made mouthguard,\" Dr. Winters said. \"The benefits of protecting your child far outweigh the costs associated with a dental or medical injury, which is likelier to occur with a store-bought model.\"</p><p>Custom-made mouthguards also can last longer than store-bought models and may be less prone to damage by the athletes, said AGD Spokesperson Eugene Antenucci, DDS, FAGD. \"Over-the-counter mouthguards are not fitted to the athlete\\'s mouth, making them less comfortable than custom guards made by a dentist,\" said Dr. Antenucci. \"When a mouthguard is not comfortable, the athlete is likely to chew it, reducing its thickness and resulting in less protection.\"</p><p>Dr. Antenucci offers the following tips for caring for a custom-made mouthguard: </p><ul><li>    After each use, brush your mouthguard with a toothbrush and cool (not hot) water.  </li><li>  Keep your mouthguard in a well-ventilated, plastic storage box when not in use.

       " 'New easier to harden dental filling material makes dental treatment faster and easier\\n <p>In modern dentistry, amalgam fillings have become unpopular. Instead, white composite materials are more commonly used, which at first glance can hardly be distinguished from the tooth. The majority of these composites are based on photoactive materials that harden when they are exposed to light. But as the light does not penetrate very deeply into the material, the patients often have to endure a cumbersome procedure in which the fillings are applied and hardened in several steps. The Vienna University of Technology in collaboration with the company Ivoclar Vivadent have now developed a new generation of photoactive materials based on the element Germanium. Simply put, improved photoreactivity is good news for everyone who wants to spend as little time as possible in the dental chair.</p><p><strong>Hardening With Light</strong></p><p>Similar to natural tooth enamel, modern dental composites consist of a mixture of different material components. In addition to inorganic fillers they can also contain photoactive organic resins which react to light of a particular wavelength and readily solidify.</p><p>Professor Robert Liska and his team at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Vienna) have been working with such photoactive substances for a long time. Similar photoactive substances are used for additional applications including protective coatings and modern 3d-printing.</p><p>The penetration depth of the light depends on its wavelength. \"Usually, light in the violet and ultraviolet region is used\", says Robert Liska. It is also possible to use light with longer wavelengths, which penetrates deeper into the material, but then the polymerization process is less efficient. If the filling cannot be hardened in one step, the procedure has to be repeated several times. If the cavity is large, this can be rather uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Germanium-based Compound Initiates Chain Reaction</strong></p><p>This problem can now be solved with a new Germanium-based molecule. It only makes up 0.04% of the composite material, but it plays a crucial role. The molecule is split into two parts by blue light, creating radicals, which initiate a chain reaction: molecular compounds, which are already present in the filling, assemble into polymers, and the material hardens.</p><p>The Germanium-based photo initiator was created at the Vienna University of Technology and then extensively tested by Ivoclar Vivadent. At Graz University of Technology, the physicochemical mechanism was investigated further. Using this new compound, the hardening depth could be increased from 2 mm to 4 mm, which considerably reduces the duration of the medical procedure.</p><p>Based on these excellent results, the Vienna University of Technology and Ivoclar Vivadent have made additional strides to further extend their collective research insterests in dental materials. Already in 2012, the Institute for Applied Synthetic Chemistry together with the Institute for Materials Science and Technology with collective funding from Ivoclar Vivadent and the Christian Doppler Research Association put into place a Laboratory for \"Photopolymers in digital and restorative dentistry\". Since its inception the laboratory has Goals for the laboratory include the development of improved photosensitive substances for dentistry with additional research efforts placed on 3D-printing of ceramic implants.  </p> \\nIn modern dentistry, amalgam fillings have become unpopular.

These adverse effects were persistent in early maturing girls, who remained at a distinct disadvantage, even as peers caught up to them in physical development, Rudolph said.</p><p>\"In girls, early maturation seems to trigger immediate psychological and environmental risks and consequent depression,\" Rudolph said. \"Pubertal changes cause early maturing girls to feel badly about themselves, cope less effectively with social problems, affiliate with deviant peers, enter riskier and more stressful social contexts and experience disruption and conflict within their relationships.\"</p><p>Early maturation did not appear to have these immediate adverse effects on boys, who showed significantly lower levels of depression at the outset than their female counterparts.

First, researchers must consider the time frame for assessing symptoms of depression, such as measuring symptoms at both the beginning and end of treatment and distinguishing between lifetime versus current symptoms. A second consideration pertains to the debate about whether to address comorbid depression within substance abuse treatment, and if so, how. Measuring comorbid symptoms at the beginning and end of treatment even when depression is not specifically addressed during treatment would help to answer this question. Third, it is also important to assess comorbidity both dimensionally (i.e., severity level) and categorically (i.e., meets criteria for a disorder) in order to fully understand the effects of depression on treatment success.  Fourth, researchers should consider the timing of comorbid symptoms relative to the substance use disorder since substance use disorders can occur before, after, or simultaneously with the onset of depression.</p><p>\"Clarification based on rigorous research studies will permit researchers to identify the conditions under which depression can influence substance abuse treatment retention and outcomes, which in turn will help to specify when depression needs to be directly addressed with this population of young people,\" explained the researchers.</p> \\nAlthough depression and substance use disorders commonly co-occur in adolescents, little is known about how depression influences adolescent substance use disorder treatment retention and...\\n',\n",
       " 'Serotonin\\'s early role in the assembly of brain circuits\\n <p>A lot of research has shown that poor regulation of the serotonin system, caused by certain genetic variations, can increase the risk of developing psychiatric illnesses such as autism, depression, or anxiety disorders.

The researchers were able to show that this receptor, which is expressed in inhibitory interneurons (cells that regulate excitement in order to avoid potentially pathological cerebral over activity), was indispensable in order for neurons to find their correct location in the developing cortex.</p><p>Psychological vulnerability caused by incorrectly assembled cortical circuits? Through a series of experiments in mice, scientists were able to demonstrate that stimulating this receptor modifies the activity and migration of the interneurons during a specific phase in their migratory process. This mechanism allows them to position themselves correctly in the different layers of the cortex, a key step in the development of brain circuits. Conversely, a poorly functioning receptor can change the setup of the circuits, and could potentially explain the behavioural problems observed in the mice. Identifying the role of this receptor in the migration of cortical interneurons therefore makes it possible to propose a new mechanism for better understanding how early dysregulation of serotonin can alter the assembly of cortical circuits, and potentially cause increased vulnerability to mental illnesses.</p><p>This study opens the door to larger studies on the role of serotonin in brain development. \"Our discovery poses several important questions,\" emphasised Alexandre Dayer, \"including about the use of medicine by pregnant women which could modify foetal serotonin levels.

       " 'How the brain manages stress suggests new model of depression\\n <p>Discovery of new molecular and behavioural connections may provide a foundation for the development of new treatments to combat some forms of depression</p><p>The brain\\'s ability to effectively deal with stress or to lack that ability and be more susceptible to depression, depends on a single protein type in each person\\'s brain, according to a study conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and published n the journal <em>Nature.</em></p><p>The Mount Sinai study findings challenge the current thinking about depression and the drugs currently used to treat the disorder.</p><p>\"Our findings are distinct from serotonin and other neurotransmitters previously implicated in depression or resilience against it,\" says the study\\'s lead investigator, Eric J. Nestler, MD, PhD, Nash Family Professor, Chair of the Department of Neuroscience and Director of the Friedman Brain Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"These data provide a new pathway to find novel and potentially more effective antidepressants.\"</p><p>The protein involved in this new model of depression is beta-catenin (B-catenin), which is expressed throughout the brain and is known to have many biological roles. Using mouse models exposed to chronic social stress, Mount Sinai investigators discovered that it is the activity of the protein in the D2 neurons, a specific set of nerve cells (neurons) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the brain\\'s reward and motivation center, which drives resiliency.</p><p>Specifically, the research team found that animals whose brains activated B-catenin were protected against stress, while those with inactive B-catenin developed signs of depression in their behavior. The study also showed suppression of this protein in brain tissue of depressed patients examined post mortem.</p><p>\"Our human data are notable in that we show decreased activation of B-catenin in depressed humans, regardless of whether these individuals were on or off antidepressants at the time of death,\" says the study\\'s co-lead investigator, Caroline Dias, an MD-PhD student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"This implies that the antidepressants were not adequately targeting this brain system.\"</p><p>In the study, researchers blocked B-catenin in the D2 brain cells in mice that had previously shown resilience to depression and found the animals became susceptible to stress. Conversely, activating B-catenin in stress mice bolstered their resilience to stress.</p><p>Nearly all nerve cells in the NAc brain region are called medium spiny neurons. These cells are divided into two types based on how they detect the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is important in regulating reward and motivation. One type of neuron detects dopamine with D1 receptors and the other with D2 receptors. The Mount Sinai data specifically implicate the D2 neurons in mediating deficits in reward and motivation that contribute to depression or enhancements that mediate resilience.</p><p>Examining the genes regulated by B-catenin, the team then traced the pathway that was engaged when B-catenin was activated in the D2 neurons and discovered a novel connection between the protein and Dicer1, an enzyme important in making microRNAs, small molecules which control gene expression.</p><p>\"While we have identified some of the genes that are targeted, future studies will be key to see how these genes affect depression. Presumably, they are important in mediating the pro-resilient effects of the B-catenin-Dicer cascade,\" says Dr. Dias.</p><p>While the molecular underpinnings of depression have remained elusive despite decades of research, the new Mount Sinai study breaks new ground in understanding depression in three important ways. It is the first report that B-catenin is deficient in nucleus accumbens in human depression and mouse depression models; it is the first study to show that higher activity of B-catenin drives resilience and the first report demonstrating a strong connection between B-catenin and control of microRNA synthesis.</p><p>The findings also suggest that future therapy for depression could be aimed at bolstering resilience against stress.</p><p>\"While most prior efforts in antidepressant drug discovery have focused on ways to undo the bad effects of stress, our findings provide a pathway to generate novel antidepressants that instead activate mechanisms of natural resilience,\" says Dr. Nestler. </p> \\nDiscovery of new molecular and behavioural connections may provide a foundation for the development of new treatments to combat some forms of depressionThe brain\\'s ability to effectively...\\n',\n",
       " 'Experts review advances in understanding and treatment of bipolar disorder\\n <p>Several lines of research have opened exciting new frontiers in scientific understanding and clinical management of bipolar disorder. Recent advances in bipolar disease research are described in this month\\'s special issue of<em> Harvard Review of Psychiatry</em>. The journal is published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, a part of Wolters Kluwer Health.</p><p>Bipolar disease is a \"prevalent, complex, and hard-to-treat illness [leading] to extreme and erratic shifts of mood, thinking, and behavior, with a very high risk of suicide as well as increased risks of dying from common medical disorders,\" write Guest Editors Dost OngÃ\\x83Â¼r, MD, PhD, of McLean Hospital, Belmont, Mass., and AyÃ\\x85Å¸egÃ\\x83Â¼l Yildiz, MD, of Dokuz EylÃ\\x83Â¼l University, Izmir, Turkey. The special issue presents concise updates on recent advances in basic science and clinical research into bipolar disorder, contributed by internationally renowned experts in the field.</p><p><strong>Experts\\' Perspectives on Recent Advances in Bipolar Disorder</strong></p><p>The papers grew out of a recent meeting of leading researchers in bipolar disorder in Cappadocia Turkey, sponsored by the Depression & Bipolar Disorder Foundation (DUVAK). The DUVAK is a foundation raised for investigating the frequency and prevention of suicidal acts and deaths associated with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar or manic depressive disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Dr Yildiz, the president of the meeting and DUVAK, notes that Cappadocia was selected as the meeting place because bipolar, or manic-depressive, disorder was first described by Aretaeus in Cappadocia nearly 2,000 years ago.</p><p>The experts who spoke at the conference were asked to contribute brief reports for the special issue, highlighting important new findings in the pathophysiology, neurobiology, and treatment of bipolar disorder. The papers provide accessible updates in critical areas of bipolar disease research, including:</p><p>The role of white matter disease. Studies have linked the cognitive and emotional difficulties in bipolar disease to \"widespread signs of disrupted white matter microstructure.\" There\\'s evidence that long-term treatment with lithium--a mainstay of treatment for bipolar disorder--counteracts this effect, increasing functional connectivity between key brain areas. Further studies of white matter structure may help to explain the biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder.</p><p>Stress and HPA axis function. Researchers exploring new approaches to understanding the interrelated effects of stress and genetic factors in patients vulnerable to dipolar disorder. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis--which plays a critical role is stress responses--could contribute to the neurocognitive impairment seen in this condition. This line of research could lead to new \"testable hypotheses\" regarding the development of bipolar disorder.</p><p>Effectiveness of lithium. About one-third of patients treated for bipolar disease have an excellent response to lithium. Research has identified a wide range of factors associated with lithium responsiveness, including patient, clinical, and, more recently, genetic characteristics. Ongoing studies will provide new insights into the genes and pathways affecting lithium responsiveness.</p><p>Stimulants for bipolar disorder.There is continued debate over the use of stimulants for depression, especially bipolar depression. Research suggests that some stimulants--particularly modafinil and related drugs--can have augmentative effects to standard treatment for bipolar disorder, including possible reduction in manic behaviors.</p><p>Functional remediation. Although many interventions have been proven effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder, only a few studies have addressed the issue of functional recovery. A Spanish group reports on a functional remediation program for bipolar disorder, including training in neurocognitive skills for patients to incorporate into their daily routines. This \"neuro-cognitive-behavioral\" approach shows promise in improving functioning for some groups of patients.</p><p>Issues in network meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis--a technique enabling indirect comparison of treatment alternatives--is a promising approach to comparing the benefits, risks, and costs of specific treatments. However, some important cautions need to be observed, especially in attempting to compare studies that are not closely similar and in situations where outcomes are typically assessed by rating scales rather than objective biological measures--as is the case in bipolar disorder.</p><p>\"We are pleased to share these brief reports in this most important field with a wider audience,\" Drs OngÃ\\x83Â¼r, and Yildiz conclude. Together with the editors of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, they hope the perspectives presented in their special issue will increase awareness and stimulate further research to better understand bipolar disorder and to develop effective treatments for the millions of affected patients worldwide.</p> \\nSeveral lines of research have opened exciting new frontiers in scientific understanding and clinical management of bipolar disorder.\\n',\n",

These findings are just a few of the key outcomes stemming from The Impact of Depression at Work Audit (IDeA), evaluating the societal and economic burden of depression in the workplace. Employers Health, an Ohio-based employer coalition, announced results for the U.S. survey at the National Business Coalition on Health annual meeting in Washington, D.C.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, in a given year, one in 10 Americans will suffer from a depressive illness. Furthermore, clinical depression, or major depressive disorder, is now the second-leading cause of disability worldwide. The IDeA survey demonstrates the incidence of depression is significantly impacting productivity in the workplace. In fact, 64 percent of survey participants reported cognitive-related challenges, as defined by difficulty concentrating, indecisiveness and/or forgetfulness, have the most impact on their ability to perform tasks at work as normal. Presenteeism (being at work, but not engaged/productive) has been found to be exacerbated by these challenges related to thinking on the job.</p><p>Despite how depression is affecting our workforce, 58 percent of employees surveyed who have been diagnosed with depression indicate they had not told their employer of their disease. In addition, 49 percent felt telling their employer would put their job a risk and, given the economic climate, 24 percent felt it was too risky to share their diagnosis with their employer.</p><p>\"The survey provides evidence surrounding the detrimental impact of depression on the U.S. workforce and the associated stigma of the disease,\" said Brian Klepper, chief executive officer of the National Business Coalition on Health. \"The results demonstrate the vital need for employers to provide support and resources in the workplace for those suffering from this debilitating disease.\"</p><p>These figures directly contribute to the estimated $100 billion annually spent on depression costs by U.S. employers including $44 billion a year in lost productivity alone. Additionally, mental illness short-term disability claims are growing by 10 percent annually. Unfortunately, this prevalence and unmet need does not currently translate into help for people with depression, as more than 35 percent of managers reported receiving no formal support or resources to guide their employees.</p><p>Yet, research shows that supporting the needs of those living with depression makes a difference. In fact, a cost-benefit modeling study by Lo Sasso et al. suggests every one dollar invested by employers in enhanced depression care yields approximately three dollars for the company in the form of productivity gains by employees.</p><p>With firsthand experience in observing the detrimental impact of depression on employers, Employers Health Coalition, Inc. and The Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation, united to create the Right Direction initiative, a first-of-its-kind, free depression awareness campaign designed to provide employers with the tools needed to address and manage the effects of depression for employees. The initiative offers a wealth of turn-key resources - ranging from content for intranet sites to template PowerPoint presentations - for employers that can be customized to communicate with the c-suite, managers and employees.</p><p>\"We designed the Right Direction initiative to specifically cater to the needs of employers, in order to ensure this resource is as helpful and easy to execute as possible,\" said Marcas Miles, senior director of marketing and communications with Employers Health Coalition. \"The goal of the initiative is to raise awareness and reduce stigma around depression in order to provide a more productive workplace and supportive company culture.\"</p> \\nAnd more than half reported challenges related to thinking on the job resulting in reduced productivity \\tDepression causes an average of 10 lost working days per episode Managers...\\n',\n",
       " 'Therapeutic advances or fads in psychotropic drug prescribing?\\n <p>Why are psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants, psychostimulants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics are increasingly prescribed in North America? Drawing a parallel between the dilemmas facing medicine in the nineteenth century and those that currently exist in the field of mental health, the sociologist and historian Johanne Collin, a professor at the Universite de Montreal\\'s Faculty of Pharmacy, believes this increase in prescriptions is partly explained by the therapeutic reasoning of physicians.</p><p>\"There is an increase in the number of people who receive prescriptions for psychotropic drugs and a growing tendency to prescribe several psychotropic drugs to the same patient. More and more children, adolescents, and young adults are taking psychotropic medications and are increasingly prescribed more than one psychotropic medication at a time,\" Collin said. Many theories could be advanced to explain this phenomenon: physicians\\' lack of knowledge, the influence of the pharmaceutical industry, patient demands or even a possible \"fashion factor\" when new drugs are marketed. \"While we cannot exclude external factors when explaining the prescription increase, we must also take into account the therapeutic reasoning of physicians, who do not prescribe drugs solely under the influence of external factors,\" Collin explained.</p><p>Drawing on a genealogy of the prescribing practices of physicians in the field of mental health that she has prepared, Collin shows that there are tensions in clinical reasoning today that already existed in the nineteenth century, between patient-specific considerations and the universality of disease and treatments.</p><p>She recalls that for much of the nineteenth century, physicians based their diagnostic and therapeutic approach on the specificity of patients, and not diseases. In other words, they considered patients unique, whatever their disease, and as such, their treatments were \"tailor-made.\" For Collin, the parallel with psychiatry since the mid-twentieth century is striking. \"The psychoanalytical approach that dominated in the mid-twentieth century postulated that what occurred in the minds of patients needed to be addressed in terms of their specificity and experience. Psychiatry was thus dominated by the primacy of patient specificity. Since the rise of modern psychopharmacology and the discovery of the first antidepressants and antipsychotics, we now assume that what occurs in the brain is physical and biological--thus going from the specificity of the patient to that of the mental disease, regardless of the patient or the circumstances leading to the onset and course of the disease. The primacy of the universality of mental disease and the standardization of diagnostics and drug treatments has become dominant in mental health,\" Collin said.</p><p>Regarding the treatment of depression today, Collin notes that about 80% of antidepressants are prescribed by family physicians. According to her, their process of reasoning is similar to how their counterparts approached their patients in the nineteenth century in that they mostly take into account the situation of their patients, their difficulties, and their specificity. \"We are faced with a social phenomenon in which people visit a doctor because they do not feel well for all sorts of reasons, but it is not necessarily a question of mental illness. The doctors then have a tool before them that can often work, the antidepressant, which has become a sort of panacea. This is another reason for the prescription increase,\" says Collins.</p><p>Psychiatrists, meanwhile, manage more complex disorders, such as autism. Although in this case, prescription practices are based on complex clinical reasoning, Collin shows that the therapeutic strategies of psychiatrists are directed against specific symptoms and not against mental illnesses as separate entities. \"As was the case in medicine in the late nineteenth century, psychiatrists prescribe drugs on a one-to-one basis, trying to regulate and counter a variety of physical symptoms with a variety of drugs,\" Collin explained.</p><p>Collin highlights the strong tension between the reality of medical and psychiatric practice, and the reference to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM). The DSM represents a nomenclature of mental health that establishes criteria for diagnosing mental health problems. Since 1980, successive editions of the DSM have taken less and less account of the patient experience in diagnoses and have lowered the criteria and thresholds for considering that a person has a mental health problem.</p><p>\"On the one hand, there is constant expansion of diagnostic categories in the DSM, which aims to standardize diagnostic and therapeutic practices, and on the other hand, we work with patients whose life experiences are complex. What doctors say is that the DSM does not correspond to real practice. They are caught in the tension between wanting to consider patients as specific individuals, to tailor treatments to them, and the need for standardized practice,\" explains Collin. \"It seems that the desire for psychiatry based on a kind of universalism is removed from the reality of doctors and psychiatrists, who stress the need for a comprehensive approach involving the bio-psycho-social dimensions of the patient,\" she concludes.</p> \\nWhy are psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants, psychostimulants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics are increasingly prescribed in North America?\\n',\n",

Compared with the wait-list control group, the participants receiving CETA experienced a significantly greater reduction in both depression (77% vs. 40% reduction in mean baseline depression scores for CETA vs. control group) and posttraumatic symptoms (75% vs 37% reduction in mean baseline symptoms for CETA vs. control group) over an average of 3 months.

Of those with depression, 55% showed signs of pathological guilt, while 20% of the non-depressed children had \"excessive guilt.\"</p><p><strong>The researchers explain that pathological guilt can be a symptom of clinical depression and other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and bipolar disorder.</strong></p><p>\"A child with pathological guilt can walk into a room and see a broken lamp, for example,\" Belden says, \"and even if the child didn\\'t break it, he or she will start apologizing.

       " 'Predicting U.S. soldier suicides following psychiatric hospitalization\\n <p>A study that looked at predicting suicides in U.S. Army soldiers after they are hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder suggests that nearly 53 percent of posthospitalization suicides occurred following the 5 percent of hospitalizations with the highest predicted suicide risk, according to a report in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>.</p><p> The suicide rate in the U.S. Army has increased since 2004 and now exceeds the rate among civilians. Still, suicide is a rare outcome even among recently discharged psychiatric patients. A potentially promising approach to assess posthospitalization suicide risk would be to use administrative data to generate an actuarial posthospitalization suicide risk algorithm. Previous research has suggested that actuarial suicide prediction is more accurate than predictions based on clinical judgment, according to background information in the study.</p><p> Researcher Ronald C. Kessler, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School, Boston, and co-authors sought to develop such an algorithm for predicting suicide in the 12 months after a soldier was hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder so that expanded posthospitalization care might be targeted to soldiers classified as having high suicide risk. A variety of administrative data were used. There were 53,769 hospitalizations of active duty soldiers from January 2004 through December 2009 with psychiatric admission diagnoses.</p><p> The study results indicate that 68 soldiers died by suicide within 12 months of being discharged from the hospital (12 percent of all U.S. Army suicides), which is equivalent to 263.9 suicides per 100,000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100,000 per-years in the total U.S. Army.</p><p> Researchers found the strongest predictors included sociodemographic factors such as being male, late-age of enlistment, criminal offenses, weapons possession, prior suicidality, aspects of prior psychiatric treatment (such as the number of antidepressant prescriptions filled in 12 months) and disorders diagnosed during the hospitalizations.</p><p> A total of 52.9 percent of the posthospitalization suicides occurred after the 5 percent of hospitalizations with the highest predicted suicide risk (3824.1 suicides per 100,000 person-years), according to the study. Soldiers in the highest predicted suicide risk stratum (group) had seven unintentional injury deaths, 830 suicide attempts and 3,765 subsequent hospitalizations within 12 months of hospital discharge.</p><p> \"Although interventions in this high-risk stratum would not solve the entire U.S. Army suicide problem given that posthospitalization suicides account for only 12 percent of all U.S. Army suicides, the algorithm would presumably help target preventive interventions. Before clinical implementation, though, several key issues must be addressed,\" the researchers note.</p><p> The authors conclude: \"The high concentration of risk of suicides and other adverse outcomes might justify targeting expanded posthospitalization interventions to soldiers classified as having highest post-hospitalization suicide risk, although final determination requires careful consideration of intervention costs, comparative effectiveness and possible adverse effects.\"</p> \\nA study that looked at predicting suicides in U.S. Army soldiers after they are hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder suggests that nearly 53 percent of posthospitalization suicides occurred...\\n',\n",
       " 'Virtual reality helps people to comfort and accept themselves\\n <p>Self-compassion can be learned using avatars in an immersive virtual reality, finds new research led by UCL. This innovative approach reduced self-criticism and increased self-compassion and feelings of contentment in naturally self-critical individuals. The scientists behind the MRC-funded study say it could be applied to treat a range of clinical conditions including depression.</p><p>The team of psychologists and computer scientists from UCL, University of Barcelona and University of Derby designed a method to improve people\\'s compassion to themselves, by creating a unique self-to-self situation using avatars and computer gaming technology. Virtual reality has previously been used to treat psychological disorders including phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder but this research focused on a new application for promoting emotional well-being.</p><p>In the study published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, 43 healthy but self-critical women experienced a life-size virtual body substituting their own, giving a first person perspective of a virtual room through the eyes of the avatar.</p><p>The participants were all trained to express compassion towards a distressed virtual child while in their adult virtual body. As they talked to the crying child, it appeared to listen and respond positively to the compassion. After a few minutes, 22 of the participants were then transferred to the virtual child body and from this perspective they saw their original virtual adult body deliver their own compassionate words and gestures to them. The remaining 21 participants observed their original virtual adult body express compassion to the child from a third person perspective. The participants were surveyed for mood, state and personality traits before and after the experiment using verified tests.</p><p>Professor Mel Slater, co-author from ICREA-University of Barcelona and UCL Computer Science, said: \"When you wear a head-mounted display and look down towards yourself and see a virtual body replacing and moving like your own, and also see it in a mirror, this gives a powerful clue to the brain that this is your body. We have shown before that when adults are embodied in a virtual child body that this influences their perceptions of the world and themselves to become child-like. Here they experienced receiving compassion from their adult selves while embodied as a child.\"</p><p>Dr Caroline Falconer, first author from UCL Clinical Educational & Health Psychology, said: \"Women who experienced a first person perspective through the eyes of the virtual child were soothed - they felt safe and content and had increased self-compassion and a lower level of self-criticism. For these women, we created a unique situation where they can have a kind and reassuring word with themselves. In contrast, those who experienced a third person perspective only reported reduced self-criticism, which highlights the benefit of a first person, self-to-self experience in immersive virtual reality when cultivating self-compassion.\"</p><p>Excessive self-criticism plays a prominent role in the development and persistence of many mental health problems including depression. The scientists say people who are self-compassionate tend to have lower levels of self-criticism and are better able to cope with negative life events because self-compassion acts as a buffer, helping to promote a positive mood and general wellbeing.</p><p>Professor Chris Brewin, study lead from UCL Clinical Educational & Health Psychology, said: \"We are thrilled to see the immediate benefits the women involved in this one-off session experienced and are now pursuing a more in-depth, clinical study into our method to measure longevity of the positive effects in both healthy and depressed individuals from both sexes. We\\'re keen to find out if the benefits for women are also seen with men and those suffering from depression. If positive, we hope virtual reality-based therapy will become a viable, low-cost treatment people can use in their own home - something we believe is achievable using commercial gaming technology.\"</p><p>Professor Paul Gilbert, co-author and expert in compassion focused therapy at University of Derby, said: \"All over the world research is showing that compassion can have major effects on a whole range of psychological and neurophysiological processes.

The high prevalence is consistent with the disability, illness and psychosocial stressors that characterize these patients, according to background information in the study.</p><p> The Depression Care for Patients at Home (Depression CAREPATH) trial by Martha L. Bruce, Ph.D., M.P.H., of the Weill Cornell Medical College (Department of Psychiatry), White Plains, N.Y., and colleagues used specially trained home health care nurses to manage depression at routine home visits. The trial randomly assigned 178 nurses from six home health agencies to 12 Depression CAREPATH intervention teams or nine enhanced usual care teams. The study enrolled 306 Medicare Home Health patients 65 years and older who screened positive for depression and were followed up at three, six and 12 months. About 70 percent of patients were female with an average age of 76.5 years. Depression severity was assessed using a scale score.</p><p> According to study results, the intervention had no effect in the full sample of patients. The intervention also had no effect in the subsample of patients with mild depression (a depression score of less than 10) because depression scores did not differ at any follow-up points. However, the Depression CAREPATH intervention was effective among 208 patients with a depression score of 10 or greater with lower depression scores at three months (14.1 vs. 16.1), at six months (12 vs. 14.7) and at 12 months (11.8 vs. 15.7).</p><p> \"Medicare recommends depression screening and intervention, but the clinical needs of home health care patients, the scarcity of mental health specialists and the structure and practice of home health care pose challenges to this goal.

Aware and SilverCloud Health together with School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin, formed a partnership to conduct a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) of the online \\'Life Skills Programme\\', which targets symptoms of low mood by promoting the development of life skills, proven to enhance wellbeing.</p><p> In Ireland, approximately one in ten people suffer from depression at any one time. CIPC (Counselling in Primary Care) meets some of that burden however, service provision is under stress due to a shortage of trained mental health practitioners. In 2013, a budget investment of &euro;35m was made available to mental health services, with up to 477 posts created to enhance general adult and child and adolescent provision. At the end of the year, Dec 2013, 205 (or 43%) of these posts were filled with approximately 272 remaining open*.</p><p>  Online programmes such as the Life Skills programme increase the ability to address a much wider audience while achieving the same quality of service as face-to-face treatments, providing an approximate increase of 6-fold in terms of service capacity.  Participants use the programme for eight weeks, with the support of weekly reviews from their designated Aware-trained supporter, who provides encouragement, feedback and guidance.  </p><p>  The researchers at TCD began last January to recruit participants for a randomised controlled trial, the gold standard in research.  The aim of which was to evaluate the effectiveness of the online intervention in improving symptoms of depression and quality of life.</p><p>  The results indicated significant improvement for those who used the programme with over 70% moving to below the threshold of clinical depression symptoms (<14) on the Beck Depression Inventory. While those who did not have access experienced no significant improvements. In terms of service provision those who had access to programme demonstrated the same results that one would expect to see in a similar face-to-face trial with clinicians.</p><p> Dr. Claire Hayes, Aware\\'s Clinical Director said, \"SilverCloud Health\\'s technology in partnership with Aware\\'s resources and expertise, has helped us implement a highly successful and accessible service for people experiencing depression and low mood in Ireland.\"</p><p> While depression has recently been found to be the second leading cause of disability in the world (GBD study, 2013) it is more important than ever that we look to increase the reach and availability of quality service provision, in a sustainable and cost effective way.</p><p> According to Dr. Derek Richards, Director of Clinical Research & Innovation at SilverCloud Health and Research Fellow at School of Psychology TCD, \"SilverCloud\\'s online programmes allow for the provision of interventions that have low levels of demand on clinical resources, and are accessible to people, regardless of geographical location or financial standing. The research project undertaken by TCD, SilverCloud and Aware provides evidence that such low-intensity programmes show clinically significant results in an Irish population.\" </p><p> According to Dr. Ladislav Timulak, Associate Professor of Counselling Psychology, School of Psychology, TCD, \"the results of the programme show significant clinical improvement for the people undertaking the intervention, relative to the people on the wait-list control\".</p><p> Furthermore, this project allowed SilverCloud to evaluate the impact of their technology solution, which is tailored to address the limitations of previously developed online programmes, and also facilitated Aware to examine the feasibility and value of providing a national online service, free of charge.

       " 'Acoustic changes in speech of people with depression could be used to help monitor mental health\\n <p>Imagine this scenario: You\\'ve been feeling persistently blue lately, so you pull out your phone. Instead of asking Siri to tell you a joke, though, you open an app that records you simply talking about your day. A few hours later, your therapist sends you a message asking if you\\'d like to meet.</p><p>A program like this one that analyzes your speech and uses it to gain information about your mental health could soon be feasible, thanks in part to research from the University of Maryland showing that certain vocal features change as patients\\' feelings of depression worsen. The team behind the work presented their findings at the 168th meeting of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA).</p><p>The research is part of an interdisciplinary initiative at the University of Maryland to engineer patient-focused mental health monitoring systems. Rather than relying solely on patients\\' self-reports, these systems could monitor both physical and psychological symptoms of mental illness on a regular basis and provide both patients and their mental health providers with feedback about their status.</p><p>To conduct a quantitative experiment on the vocal characteristics of depression acoustician Carol Espy-Wilson and her colleagues repurposed a dataset collected from a 2007 study from an unaffiliated lab also investigating the relationship between depression and speech patterns. The earlier study assessed patients\\' depression levels each week using the Hamilton Depression Scale (a standard clinical evaluation tool to measure the severity of depression) and then recorded them speaking freely about their day.</p><p>The University of Maryland researchers used data from six patients who, over the six-week course of the previous study, had registered as depressed some weeks and not depressed other weeks. They compared these patients\\' Hamilton scores with their speech patterns each week, and found a correlation between depression and certain acoustic properties.</p><p>When patients\\' feelings of depression were worst, their speech tended to be breathier and slower. The team also found increases in jitter and shimmer, two measures of acoustic disturbance that measure the frequency and amplitude variation of the sound, respectively. Speech high in jitter and shimmer tends to sound hoarse or rough.</p><p>The researchers plan to repeat the study in a larger population, this time comparing speech patterns in individuals with no history of mental illness to those with depression to create an acoustic profile of depression-typical speech. A phone app could use this information to analyze patients\\' speech, identify acoustic signatures of depression and provide feedback and support.</p><p>Espy-Wilson hopes the interactive technology will appeal to teens and young adults, a particularly vulnerable group for mental health problems. \"Their emotions are all over the place during this time, and that\\'s when they\\'re really at risk for depression. We have to reach out and figure out a way to help kids in that stage,\" she said.</p><p>Sometimes, patients might not recognize or be willing to admit that they are depressed. By receiving regular feedback based on acoustical and other measurements, they might learn to self-monitor their mental states and recognize when they should seek help. The technology could also promote communication between therapists and patients, allowing for continuous, responsive care in addition to regular in-person appointments.</p><p>The researchers acknowledge that developing an effective app requires a larger scope than just the underlying science - a challenge they plan to address. \"We definitely need human factors to develop something that people will use,\" said Espy-Wilson. \"There\\'s a lot that has to go into making this a useful tool.\"</p> \\nImagine this scenario: You\\'ve been feeling persistently blue lately, so you pull out your phone.\\n',\n",

The results were published in The Spine Journal.</p><p>\"The results indicate that attention should be paid to even mild depressive symptoms both before and after the surgery. This would allow health care professionals to recognise patients who might benefit from enhanced psychosocial support as part of their surgery-related treatment and rehabilitation process,\" says Maarit Pakarinen, MD, the first author of the article.</p><p>The correlation between depression and short-term treatment outcome has been observed in earlier research. However, this recently published study was the first to show that depressive symptoms that are milder than actual depression also weaken the surgical outcome during a long-term follow-up.</p><p>Common in elderly people, lumbar spinal stenosis, LSS, is a medical condition that causes symptoms in the back and lower limbs, e.g., pain and intermittent claudication. In cases where conservative treatment fails, surgery is indicated, but the results of surgery vary.

Before surgery, the patients filled out a survey charting their mental status, feelings of pain, and functional capacity such as limitations to walking, lifting or sitting. The survey was repeated three months, one year, two years, and five years after surgery. Patients with depressive symptoms suffered from a weaker functional capacity than non-depressive patients during the entire five year follow-up.

       " 'How psychodynamic therapy for depression may change brain function\\n <p>A study from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators has identified for the first time changes in the metabolic activity of a key brain region in patients successfully treated for depression with psychodynamic psychotherapy, suggesting a mechanism of action behind one of the most historically important and widely practiced forms of therapy. They also found evidence that pretreatment metabolism in a different brain structure might predict which patients are likely to respond to that form of therapy. Their report will appear in the journal <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em> and has been issued online.</p><p>Considered to be a successor of Freudian analysis, psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on how a patient\\'s prior life experiences, particularly important relationships, influence their character and how they relate to others. Through exploration of a patient\\'s past and current relationships - including the relationship with the therapist - therapy focuses on helping the patient gain insights that can change both mood and behavior.</p><p>\"Psychodynamic psychotherapy might be considered the original form of \\'personalized medicine,\\' since it draws directly from a patient\\'s unique experiences to shape the course of treatment,\" says Joshua Roffman, MD, MGH Department of Psychiatry, lead author of the report. \"While it has been a core part of psychiatric training for decades and continues to be widely practiced, psychodynamic psychotherapy hasn\\'t been studied as broadly as have other approaches for a number of reasons, including its greater subjectivity and treatment-by-treatment variability. We do know that psychodynamic treatments are effective for some patients, and this study examined whether differences in neural activity could predict which patients would complete the course of therapy and which would drop out, a common occurrence for any type of therapy.\"</p><p>The study enrolled 16 patients diagnosed with major depression for whom previous treatment with medication had not been successful. Prior to beginning the therapy program, participants received standardized assessments of their depression symptoms and of psychological mindedness - the capacity to recognize and understand their own emotions, motivations and actions. Before the first therapy session, participants had a PET imaging procedure that assesses metabolic activity within the brain by measuring glucose uptake.</p><p>The study protocol involved 16 weekly individual psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions that, while flexible enough to be adapted to individual patients\\' needs, followed a predefined theme and sequence. With participants\\' permission, sessions were videotaped and later reviewed by another member of the study team, both to insure that sessions followed the defined pattern and to assess how well participants developed new insights through the therapy. Seven participants discontinued therapy while nine completed all therapy sessions, which were followed by a second set of PET images, taken within a week of therapy\\'s conclusion, and repeat assessment of depression symptoms.</p><p>The PET scans taken before the initiation of therapy revealed that metabolic activity of the right insula - a brain region known to be important for emotional regulation and previously implicated in depression - was higher in participants with more severe depression symptoms. Almost all of those who completed the therapy had a greater than 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, although improvement was not clinically evident until after the fourth week of treatment, on average. Reduced metabolic activity within the insula from pre- to post-treatment was associated with greater symptom reduction and was correlated with the degree of insight each participant achieved, as determined by the outside observers.</p><p>The pretreatment PET scans also revealed significant metabolic differences in an area called the right precuneus between those who went on to complete the therapy and those who dropped out, with a higher metabolic level being observed in the completers. Activity in the precuneus - which has previously been associated with self-awareness and memory - also was associated with the pretreatment level of psychological mindedness, a capacity that has been considered essential to successful psychodynamic treatment.</p><p>\"As with all psychiatric interventions, it is notoriously difficult to know ahead of time who is likely to have a good response to psychodynamic psychotherapy and who is not,\" says Roffman, an assistant professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \"Identification of biological markers that could predict treatment success is a \\'holy grail\\' in psychiatry; and while the measured differences in psychological mindedness between completers and noncompleters were insignificant, the significant difference in precuneus metabolism suggests that it may a sensitive predictor of treatment response, something that needs to be confirmed in larger trials.\" </p> \\nA study from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators has identified for the first time changes in the metabolic activity of a key brain region in patients successfully treated for...\\n',\n",

The estimated 39 million adults in persistent pain outnumber the residents of California.</p><p>Previous studies have said so much pain costs hundreds of billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and health care. And that doesn\\'t take into account pain\\'s psychic toll.</p><p>\"A sizeable portion of American adults are dealing with persistent pain and that\\'s affecting their lives profoundly,\" said Kennedy. \"Access to good pain management for this population is limited, and there\\'s a real risk that taking short-term pain medications for a long period of time will lead to dependency or addiction.\"</p><p>His study, published this month in the <em>Journal of Pain</em>, drew from the first national survey to measure persistent pain, defined as daily or nearly daily pain lasting three months, which is usually ample time for an injury to heal. The National Center for Health Statistics survey questioned 35,000 households.</p><p><strong>Determining pain\\'s economic, social costs</strong></p><p>Kennedy was inspired to look at the data after seeing the 2011 national Institute of Medicine report, which found nearly half of Americans suffer what it called chronic pain. The report\\'s chronic pain definition is more inclusive and can include arthritis, joint pain, moderate or severe pain in the past four weeks and any work or housework disability.</p><p>\"I don\\'t think that half of the population is dealing with chronic pain in the sense that we would describe chronic pain as a risk factor for deteriorating mental health and substance abuse,\" said Kennedy. \"So we wanted to come up with a subset of chronic pain that focused on something that we could look at across different chronic conditions rather than saying, \\'OK, if you\\'ve got arthritis, then you\\'ve got chronic pain.\\'\"</p><p>By focusing on persistent pain, he said, health policy makers and providers can get a clearer sense of pain\\'s economic and social costs.</p><p>\"Persistent pain is going to have the biggest impact on people\\'s daily lives,\" he said. \"If you\\'re dealing with pain constantly for a long period of time, that\\'s going to affect your work life, your family life, your social life. It also puts you at higher risk for things like mental illness and addiction.\"</p><p><strong>Pain triggers psychological distress</strong></p><p>The study presents a rough demography of the problem. Naturally, older adults are more likely to report persistent pain, particularly between the ages of 60 and 69. Women are at a higher risk than men, as are those without high school degrees. Latino and African American adults are less likely to report pain than whites.</p><p>Two-thirds of those with persistent pain said it is \"constantly present.\" Half said it is sometimes \"unbearable and excruciating.\"</p><p>People with persistent pain were also more likely to report daily feelings of anxiety, depression and fatigue. This makes sense, said Kennedy.</p><p>\"Being in pain is depressing,\" he said. \"Being in pain all the time is tiring. Being in pain all the time is anxiety-provoking. So it\\'s plausible that pain is triggering other kinds of more psychological distress.\"</p><p><strong>Policies, practices that ease pain</strong></p><p>He said he would like to see questions about persistent pain asked in future national health surveys to get a more consistent measure of it across different groups of people. And while pain is in some ways inherent in the human condition, he would like to see policies and practices that ease it.</p><p>The rate of pain could be lowered, he said, \"with responsive health systems that look at the entire person and the range of therapeutic services that they may need.

At the start of the study, all participants filled out two 10-item questionnaires on depression and anxiety asking how often they had experienced symptoms of depression in the past week and how often they suffered from anxiety symptoms such as nervousness and restlessness. While these measures did not provide a clinical diagnosis for depression and/or anxiety disorder, they reflect commonly reported symptoms of these two conditions.</p><p>Overall, 27 percent of Hispanics/Latinos in the study reported high levels of depressive symptoms, with a low of 22.3 percent among people of Mexican background and a high of 38 percent among those of Puerto Rican background.</p><p>One of the study\\'s most compelling findings was the relatively low use of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications among Hispanics and Latinos.

When combined they give an important result which, in the long term, strengthens the possibility of being able to provide the individual patient with more personalized treatment options,\" says MD-student Ole KÃ\\x83Â¶hler, who is first author of the scientific article and a member of the research group from Aarhus University.</p><p>The crucial new aspect of the meta-analysis is that it is the first time researchers can be so certain of the effect of treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p>\"However, these effects must always be weighed against the possible side effects of the anti-inflammatory drugs. We still need to clarify which patients will benefit from the medicine and the dose-sizes required,\" says Ole KÃ\\x83Â¶hler.</p><p>\"The biggest problem with depression is that we do not know the causes that trigger the condition in the individual patient. Some studies suggest that the choice of antidepressant medication can be guided by a blood sample that measures whether there is an inflammatory condition in the body. Other studies show that the same blood samples could be used as a guideline on whether a depressive patient can be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs that works better when there is inflammation present simultaneously with the depression. These findings must, however, be verified before they can be implemented in clinical practice,\" says Ole KÃ\\x83Â¶hler.</p><p>He emphasises that it is not possible to conclude on the basis of the meta-analysis that an inflammatory state can be the sole explanation for a depression.</p><p>\"The analysis should be seen as a significant milestone in a research context and this could be a landmark for what future research projects and treatment need to focus on,\" says Ole KÃ\\x83Â¶hler.</p> \\nOrdinary over the counter painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs purchased from pharmacies may also be effective in the treatment of people suffering of depression.\\n',\n",
       " 'Susceptibility for relapsing major depressive disorder can be calculated\\n <p>The question if an individual will suffer from relapsing major depressive disorder is not de-termined by accident. Neuroscientists from the Mercator Research Group \"Structure of Memory\" have chosen a new research approach, using computer-based models to study the disease. They show that chronic depression is triggered due to an unfortunate combination of internal and external factors. Their research findings were published in the journal <em>PLoS ONE</em>.</p><p>Selver Demic and his colleagues from the Mercator Research Group have set out to find out more about the causes of depression. \"Approx. 20 per cent of the population will suffer a depressive episode in the course of their lives,\" says Demic. \"This cohort of 20 per cent includes people who will never again experience any problems after that one-time episode is over. The others, however, will suffer repeatedly or chronically under the disorder, despite taking appropriate medication. We want to use our model to explain the occurrence and recurrence rates.\"</p><p><strong>Unfortunate combination of factors</strong></p><p>Demic used parameters such as forgetting rate and cognitive bias, as well as the activity levels of the endogenous mood booster serotonin, which are known to be causes of depression. External factors such as family and job situation were likewise considered. Unlike other research projects to date, he integrated all these factors into one single model. His findings were as follows: the observed frequencies could be accounted for only when there are two distinct patient groups. A high-risk group whose parameters are so unfortunately aligned that they will always suffer from recurring depressions. And another group in which depression will only occur by chance.</p><p><strong>Different disease states</strong></p><p>The scientists also wished to compile a systematic definition for the individual disease states that is based on objective facts. Psychologists and doctors already agreed on different states in the past: the depressive episode, which is diagnosed after characteristic symptoms such as lack of motivation and sadness have lasted for min. 14 days. The recovery phase, which applies when the patient has not presented any symptoms for a period of at least six months. And the remission phase, if the period between two depressive episodes is shorter than six months.</p><p><strong>Objective facts instead of intuition</strong></p><p>\"When assessing which phase the patient is currently undergoing, psychologists and doctors will also always rely on their intuition and experience. Often, it is not clear if a patient is going through the remission or the recovery phase when he shows depressive symptoms for a few days during the six-month period,\" explains Demic. Consequently, the neuroscientist developed a mathematical model, a so-called finite state machine (FSM). This tool is fed data regarding a patient\\'s state every day. Based on those data and as result of the timecourse, the FSM calculates the disease state that the patient is currently undergoing.</p><p><strong>Welcoming debates</strong></p><p>\"Our approach to understand depression is entirely novel,\" says Demic. \"Therefore, we expect animated debates with doctors, psychologists and other scientists. What\\'s important is that we have demonstrated the potential computer-based models offer with regard to research into depression.\"</p> \\nThe question if an individual will suffer from relapsing major depressive disorder is not de-termined by accident.\\n',\n",

       " 'Even depressed people believe that life gets better\\n <p>Adults typically believe that life gets better - today is better than yesterday was and tomorrow will be even better than today. A new study shows that even depressed individuals believe in a brighter future, but this optimistic belief may not lead to better outcomes. The findings are published in Clinical Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.</p><p>The research shows that middle-aged adults who had a history of depression tended to evaluate their past and current lives in more negative terms than did adults without depression, but this negativity didn\\'t extend to their beliefs about the future:</p><p>\"It turns out that even clinically depressed individuals are also characterized by the belief that one\\'s life in the future will be more satisfying than one\\'s past and current life,\" explains psychological scientist and lead researcher Michael Busseri of Brock University in Canada. \"And this pattern of beliefs appears to be a risk factor for future depression, even over a 10-year period.\"</p><p>Busseri and co-author Emily Peck of Acadia University, also in Canada, analyzed data available from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) survey, a nationally representative sample of middle-aged Americans. The researchers looked at data from both waves of the study, collected 10 years apart, and they limited their sample to those participants who were 45 years old or younger at the first wave.</p><p>In addition to demographic data, the researchers looked at participants\\' reports of life satisfaction (rated from 0 to 10, from worst life possible to best life possible) for the past, present, and future, and they also examined symptoms of depression measured via clinical interview.</p><p>Compared to non-depressed participants, MIDUS participants who showed signs of depression reported lower levels of life satisfaction at each time point: past, present, and future. Like non-depressed participants, however, the depressed participants seemed to think that life would get better over time.</p><p>And yet, the discrepancy between optimistic beliefs about the future and a more sober reality might contribute to sub-optimal outcomes for these individuals.</p><p>\"What we don\\'t know yet is whether this improved future life is actually something that depressed individuals feel they will achieve,\" Busseri explains. \"It\\'s possible, for example, that envisioning a brighter future is a form of wishful thinking - rather than a sign of encouragement and hope.\"</p><p>Looking at the participants\\' subjective trajectories across all three time points, the researchers found that non-depressed participants showed linear increases in life satisfaction from one point to the next, but depressed participants did not.

       " 'Ketamine rapidly restores pleasure-seeking ahead of other antidepressant action in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder patients\\n <p>A drug being studied as a fast-acting mood-lifter restored pleasure-seeking behavior independent of - and ahead of - its other antidepressant effects, in a National Institutes of Health trial. Within 40 minutes after a single infusion of ketamine, treatment-resistant depressed bipolar disorder patients experienced a reversal of a key symptom - loss of interest in pleasurable activities - which lasted up to 14 days. Brain scans traced the agent\\'s action to boosted activity in areas at the front and deep in the right hemisphere of the brain.</p><p>\"Our findings help to deconstruct what has traditionally been lumped together as depression,\" explained Carlos Zarate, M.D., of the NIH\\'s National Institute of Mental Health. \"We break out a component that responds uniquely to a treatment that works through different brain systems than conventional antidepressants - and link that response to different circuitry than other depression symptoms.\"</p><p>This approach is consistent with the NIMH\\'s Research Domain Criteria project, which calls for the study of functions - such as the ability to seek out and experience rewards - and their related brain systems that may identify subgroups of patients in one or multiple disorder categories.</p><p>Zarate and colleagues reported on their findings Oct. 14, 2014 in the journal Translational Psychiatry.</p><p>Although it\\'s considered one of two cardinal symptoms of both depression and bipolar disorder, effective treatments have been lacking for loss of the ability to look forward to pleasurable activities, or anhedonia. Long used as an anesthetic and sometimes club drug, ketamine and its mechanism-of-action have lately been the focus of research into a potential new class of rapid-acting antidepressants that can lift mood within hours instead of weeks.</p><p>Based on their previous studies, NIMH researchers expected ketamine\\'s therapeutic action against anhedonia would be traceable - like that for other depression symptoms - to effects on a mid-brain area linked to reward-seeking and that it would follow a similar pattern and time course.</p><p>To find out, the researchers infused the drug or a placebo into 36 patients in the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. They then detected any resultant mood changes using rating scales for anhedonia and depression. By isolating scores on anhedonia items from scores on other depression symptom items, the researchers discovered that ketamine was triggering a strong anti-anhedonia effect sooner - and independent of - the other effects.</p><p>Levels of anhedonia plummeted within 40 minutes in patients who received ketamine, compared with those who received placebo - and the effect was still detectable in some patients two weeks later. Other depressive symptoms improved within 2 hours. The anti-anhedonic effect remained significant even in the absence of other antidepressant effects, suggesting a unique role for the drug.</p><p>Next, the researchers scanned a subset of the ketamine-infused patients, using positron emission tomography (PET), which shows what parts of the brain are active by tracing the destinations of radioactively-tagged glucose - the brain\\'s fuel. The scans showed that ketamine jump-started activity not in the middle brain area they had expected, but rather in the dorsal (upper) anterior cingulate cortex, near the front middle of the brain and putamen, deep in the right hemisphere.</p><p>Boosted activity in these areas may reflect increased motivation towards or ability to anticipate pleasurable experiences, according to the researchers. Depressed patients typically experience problems imagining positive, rewarding experiences - which would be consistent with impaired functioning of this dorsal anterior cingulate cortex circuitry, they said. However, confirmation of these imaging findings must await results of a similar NIMH ketamine trial nearing completion in patients with unipolar major depression.</p><p>Other evidence suggests that ketamine\\'s action in this circuitry is mediated by its effects on the brain\\'s major excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, and downstream effects on a key reward-related chemical messenger, dopamine. The findings add to mounting evidence in support of the antidepressant efficacy of targeting this neurochemical pathway. Ongoing research is exploring, for example, potentially more practical delivery methods for ketamine and related experimental antidepressants, such as a nasal spray.</p><p>However, Ketamine is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for depression. It is mostly used in veterinary practice, and abuse can lead to hallucinations, delirium and amnesia.</p> \\nA drug being studied as a fast-acting mood-lifter restored pleasure-seeking behavior independent of - and ahead of - its other antidepressant effects, in a National Institutes of Health trial.\\n',\n",
       " 'Researchers find why depression and ageing linked to increased disease risk\\n <p>Psychological stress and stress-related psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk for aging-related diseases, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this relation are unknown. Understanding these mechanisms may contribute to the development of targeted preventive strategies and new or improved treatments for these devastating diseases. This work is presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology congress in Berlin.</p><p>Now an international group of researchers from Germany and the US has found that both ageing and depression are associated with changes in the FKBP5 gene. Genes can be regulated by the addition or removal of methyl (CH3) groups to an area of the gene.  The researchers found that ageing can decrease this methylation process, causing the FKBP5 gene to be overexpressed. They also found that when someone is depressed, this demethylation process is accelerated even further.</p><p>In a second finding they found that this increased FKBP5 expression is associated with increases in biochemical markers of inflammation and cardiovascular risk.</p><p>According to lead researcher, Dr Anthony Zannas (Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich):</p><p>\"We found that both aging and depression seem to lead to changes in how DNA is processed, and that this can control the expression of genes that regulate how we respond to stress. These changes are associated with increased inflammation, and we believe that this may lead to the increased risk for several aging-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders, that has been observed in chronically stressed and depressed individuals.</p><p>Our work shows that risk for aging-related diseases could be conferred by epigenetic changes of stress-related genes and resultant increases in the expression of inflammation markers. It\\'s too early to say that we are seeing a cause and effect, so we need to confirm the findings by using larger samples and uncover the mechanisms using animal models. If we can do that, we may have the opportunity to develop tests for age-related diseases and new ways to prevent the harmful effects of stress\".</p><p>The FKBP5 gene is found on chromosome 6 in humans. It codes the FK506 binding protein 5, also known as FKBP5. This protein is known to play a role in stress responses, immune regulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding.</p><p>Commenting on the work for the ECNP, Professor Bill Deakin (Manchester) said:</p><p>\"There is a growing realisation that depression is one expression of a set of vulnerabilities for a range of disorders associated with age including obesity, diabetes, cerebro-vascular disease and dementia. Zannas and colleagues are now beginning to unpick some of the first molecular mechanisms of the shared risk. The focus is on FKBP5 a protein transcription factor that regulates several genes relevant to depression (via stress hormones) and to disorders such as Alzheimer\\'s disease.</p><p>Experiencing trauma in childhood and ageing have long-term influences on activity of the gene for FKBP5. This epigenetic regulation is abnormal in people with depression. It is early days and these findings need to be confirmed in definitively large populations. Nevertheless, the results point the way to finding molecular subtypes of depression with specific treatments targeted on transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms\".</p> \\nPsychological stress and stress-related psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk for aging-related diseases, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this relation are unknown.\\n',\n",

Now researchers have shown it works the other way too - making people imitate a happy or sad way of walking actually affects their mood.</p><p>Subjects who were prompted to walk in a more depressed style, with less arm movement and their shoulders rolled forward, experienced worse moods than those who were induced to walk in a happier style, according to the study published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry.</p><p>CIFAR Senior Fellow Nikolaus Troje (Queen\\'s University), a co-author on the paper, has shown in past research that depressed people move very differently than happy people.</p><p>\"It is not surprising that our mood, the way we feel, affects how we walk, but we want to see whether the way we move also affects how we feel,\" Troje says.</p><p>He and his colleagues showed subjects a list of positive and negative words, such as \"pretty,\" \"afraid\" and \"anxious\" and then asked them to walk on a treadmill while they measured their gait and posture. A screen showed the subjects a gauge that moved left or right depending on whether their walking style was more depressed or happier. But the subjects didn\\'t know what the gauge was measuring.

The discovery was made thanks to decades of translational research in a few Old Order Amish families of Pennsylvania with a high incidence of both diseases. Forty years of documented research across multiple generations showed that no person with EvC has been reported with bipolar disorder.</p><p>\"No one doubts that bipolar affective disorder has an important, disease causing genetic component,\" said neurologist and geneticist Edward I. Ginns, MD, PhD, professor of psychiatry at UMMS and lead author of the study. \"In our search for the causes of bipolar affective disorder, this is a paradigm changing discovery that could lead to better treatments.\"</p><p>Bipolar affective disorder is a common psychiatric illness characterized by recurring swings from periods of high energy and mania to periods of low energy and sadness. During periods of mania the need for sleep is reduced and a person feels or acts abnormally happy, energetic and impulsive. They often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard for the consequences. Cycles of depression may include crying, poor eye contact with others, and a negative outlook on life. Patients suffering from bipolar disorder have a higher risk for suicide and self-harm and suffer from other ailments, such as heart disease, related to poor lifestyle choices.</p><p>Though many factors likely contribute to onset of the disease, various studies over the years have provided ample evidence that there is an important genetic component to the illness. However, previous attempts to isolate individual genes connected to bipolar disorder have been unsuccessful.</p><p>In her research among the Old Order Amish, which extends back more than 40 years, Janice A. Egeland, PhD, professor emerita of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at UMMSM and co-author of the current study, found that both EvC and bipolar were prevalent in an extended family descended from the same progenitor. Both conditions clearly travelled together over the generations in a few families extending from this same pioneer.

Statistical analyses confirmed the significant negative association between EvC and bipolar disorder. This further suggested that the Shh pathway plays a role in bipolar disorder.</p><p>\"Since mutations causing EvC do so by disrupting Shh protein function, linking abnormal Shh signaling to major affective disorders provides a concrete molecular and medical basis for patients\\' symptoms that should help break down the stigma associated with mental illnesses,\" said Ginns. \"If we can understand more details of the Shh signaling pathway in bipolar disorder, it could dramatically change the way we diagnose and treat these conditions.\"</p><p>According to Ginns, drugs already in clinical trials for other medical conditions that target Shh protein signaling may have the potential to be better treatments for bipolar disorder. \"Importantly, it\\'s possible that drugs that modulate Shh signaling may offer a new strategy for treating some patients with affective disorders,\" he said.</p><p>The current findings are supported by an earlier genome-wide search for genetic loci linked to mental health wellness in relatives at high risk for bipolar disorder among the Old Order Amish, published by Dr. Ginns and colleagues in PNAS (1998). \"Revisiting our work from the late 90s has paid off.

Center for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics and colleagues. The researchers write, \"PLAY offers communities a relatively inexpensive, effective intervention for children with ASD and their parents.\"</p><p><strong>Parent Coaching Sessions Lead to Improvement in Autism Outcomes</strong></p><p>128 families of three- to six-year-old children with ASD - autism or pervasive developmental disorder - in five US cities participated in the clinical trial, one of the largest, most rigorous studies of its kind in the US. Families were randomly assigned to one of two groups: either the PLAY Project plus usual community services for autism or usual community services alone. Usual community services included special education pre-school, speech/language, and occupational therapy services.</p><p>The PLAY Project group received monthly, three-hour home visits from PLAY Project consultants trained and certified in the developmental, relationship-based approach. Through coaching, modeling, and videotapes with written feedback, the consultants taught approaches to improve caregiver-child interactions and child social skills development. For example, parents learned how to identify and respond to their child\\'s subtle and hard-to-detect cues during daily play sessions.</p><p>The PLAY Project approach \"fosters parents\\' interactional abilities and play skills to promote their children\\'s functional development,\" according to the authors. Parents reported that they were able to engage their child in 15- to 20-minute play sessions and throughout daily routines, for a total of two hours per day.</p><p>After one year, families assigned to the PLAY Project program showed greater improvement in parent-child interaction.

On a standard autism rating scale, about one-half of children in the PLAY group improved by at least one category (as did one-third of children in the comparison group). However, these results must be interpreted cautiously, Dr Solomon and coauthors note: \"This kind of dramatic improvement in one year is not in agreement with clinical experience.\"</p><p>Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) based approaches, when provided by professionals instead of parents, have been shown to improve developmental outcomes in children with ASD. However, there are challenges in providing such behavioral treatments, especially due to the shortage of trained professional personnel and high costs - $30,000 to $60,000 per year per child. Recent studies have shown promising results with \"parent-mediated programs,\" like PLAY, where professionals train parents to implement behavioral techniques with their child.</p><p>This \"real-world\" study finds that coaching parents in the PLAY Project approach can improve parent-child interactions and other important outcomes for children with autism.

Depression and anxiety frequently co-exist with IBS, with a recent study reporting that 38% of IBS patients had clinically-confirmed depression (compared with 6% of healthy controls) and 32% had anxiety (compared with 13% of healthy controls).<sup>3</sup></p><p>\"The fact that so many people with IBS have anxiety and depression has led many to speculate that IBS is primarily a psychological, not a physical, disorder,\" says Prof. Elsenbruch. \"However, the condition is complex and most likely results from an interplay between psychological and biological factors. In fact, we don\\'t really know whether anxiety and depression result from having IBS or whether they contribute to the development or maintenance of symptoms. In many patients, both possibilities may be true at the same time.\"</p><p><strong>The \"brain-gut\" axis in IBS</strong></p><p>There has been significant scientific interest in the role of central nervous system mechanisms along the \"brain-gut\" axis in IBS. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that neural processing of visceral stimuli (i.e. stimuli generated from internal organs such as the intestine) is altered in IBS, with many IBS patients showing lowered pain thresholds.<sup>1</sup> In Prof. Elsenbruch\\'s latest study, painful rectal distensions were performed using a pressure-controlled barostat system in 17 patients with IBS and 17 sex- and age-matched healthy controls.1 Neural activation in pain-related brain areas was assessed using functional MRI (fMRI) while subjects received sequential intravenous administrations of saline and what they thought was an anti-spasmolytic drug (but was actually a saline placebo), in order to observe activation patterns during a typical placebo pain response.</p><p>The fMRI results in the healthy volunteers demonstrated reduced neural activation in pain-related brain areas during both the saline and sham treatment (placebo), indicating significant central pain inhibition. However, there was no such inhibition in the group of IBS patients, suggesting a deficiency in central pain inhibitory mechanisms in IBS. Interestingly, higher depression (but not anxiety) scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were associated with reduced central pain inhibition in this study.</p><p>\"Our findings suggest that patients with IBS do not process visceral pain signals in the same way as healthy people and are unable to suppress pain signals in the brain and, as a result, experience more pain from the same stimuli,\" says Prof. Elsenbruch. \"The fact that the presence of depression was associated with altered brain responses suggests that depression may contribute to these abnormal pain processes in IBS patients.\" </p> \\nHigh rates of anxiety and depression amongst patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have led many researchers to believe there could be a causal relationship between psychological factors...\\n',\n",

       " 'How thiazolidinediones work to improve glucose metabolism\\n <p>A research team led by Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital (BWH) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) has uncovered surprising new findings that underscore the role of an important signaling pathway, already known to be critical in cancer, in the development of type 2 diabetes. Their results, published in the advance online issue of the journal <em>Nature</em>, shed additional light on how a longstanding class of diabetes drugs, known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), work to improve glucose metabolism and suggest that inhibitors of the signaling pathway -- known as the MEK/ERK pathway -- may also hold promise in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>\"It\\'s been recognized that thiazolidinediones have tremendous benefits in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but they also have significant risks,\" said Alexander S. Banks, PhD, lead author and a researcher in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Hypertension at BWH. \"The question is, can we minimize these adverse effects by modifying the drugs slightly or by approaching the pathway from a different direction?\"</p><p>This hypothesis led Banks and DFCI\\'s Bruce Spiegelman, PhD, a researcher in the department of Cancer Biology at Dana-Farber, to focus on a critical molecular player known as CDK5. A type of enzyme known as a kinase, CDK modifies a key site on the molecule targeted by TZDs (known as PPARÃ\\x8eÂ³). To further understand CDK5\\'s role, Banks and his colleagues created a special strain of mice lacking CDK5 in adipose tissues -- where PPARÃ\\x8eÂ³ is most highly active and TZDs are thought to act.</p><p>Instead of confirming their initial suspicions about CDK5, the team\\'s results pointed them in a very different direction: their findings suggested that another key kinase was involved. In collaboration with researchers at Harvard Medical School, Banks, Spiegelman and their colleagues conducted a wide, unbiased search to determine its identity. That search ultimately led them to the kinase known as ERK.</p><p>After a detailed biochemical study of ERK function, the team set out to test its role in glucose metabolism, and found that MEK inhibitors, which block ERK function, significantly improve insulin resistance in mouse models of diabetes.</p><p>\"A new class of drugs, aimed primarily at cancer, has been developed that inhibits ERK\\'s action. These drugs, known as MEK inhibitors, help to extend the lives of patients with advanced cases of melanoma,\" said Banks. \"One of the most exciting aspects of this paper is the concept that you could inhibit the abnormal activation of ERK seen in diabetes using these MEK inhibitors designed for treating cancer, but at lower, safer doses.\"</p><p>\"All attempts to develop new therapeutics will carry risks, but the opportunities here certainly seem worth exploring in the clinic,\" said Spiegelman.</p><p>While much more work must be done to determine if MEK inhibitors will be a safe and effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, the Nature study offers an important window on the molecular underpinnings of TZD action.

The study appears in JAMA and is being released to coincide with its presentation at the American Heart Association\\'s Scientific Sessions 2014.</p><p>Diabetes mellitus is the most important coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factor; patients with diabetes often develop severe but asymptomatic CAD. The combination of aggressive, asymptomatic CAD has made it the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes. The development of cardiac imaging with high-resolution CCTA now provides the opportunity to evaluate the actual coronary anatomy noninvasively and ascertain the overall extent and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. However, whether routine CCTA screening in high-risk populations can effect changes in treatment (such as preemptive coronary revascularization or more aggressive medical therapy), leading to a reduction in cardiac events, remains unproven, according to background information in the article.</p><p>The trial randomly assigned 900 patients with types 1 or 2 diabetes of at least 3 to 5 years\\' duration and without symptoms of CAD to CAD screening with CCTA (n = 452) or to standard national guidelines-based optimal diabetic care (n = 448). Patients were recruited from 45 clinics and practices of a single health system (Intermountain Healthcare, Utah). Standard or aggressive therapy (for treating abnormal lipid, blood pressure and glucose levels) was recommended based on CCTA findings.</p><p>At an average follow-up time of 4 years, the primary outcome event rates (composite of all-cause death, nonfatal heart attack, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) were not significantly different between the CCTA and the control groups (6.2 percent [28 events] vs 7.6 percent [34 events]).

A large majority of European countries have also taken steps to tackle the burden of diabetes at policy level. Thirty countries now have adopted a national plan covering diabetes, and ten more have announced such a plan for the near future. This is undoubtedly positive: collecting data plays a key role in ensuring adequate policies, and national policy frameworks are a prerequisite for effective policy action and the delivery of high-quality diabetes care on the ground.</p><p>However, the report also highlights that 83% of the national registers are considered to be incomplete. When it comes to national plans covering diabetes, implementation and monitoring appear to be major weaknesses. The Czech Republic is the only country in the region that includes a strong monitoring and evaluation system in its national plan. It is also the only country to assess the cost-effectiveness of the measures within its plan.</p><p>\"In the current context where politicians across Europe repeatedly stress the need to reduce health expenditure and make healthcare systems more sustainable, it is alarming to see that cost-effectiveness analysis of policies is almost absent,\" commented Anne-Marie Felton, co-chair of the steering committee of the report.</p><p>The same goes for prevention. All but two European countries have adopted prevention policies addressing the main risk factors of diabetes, including obesity and lack of physical activity. Yet, monitoring and evaluation are lagging behind. Greece is the only country that reports monitoring and measuring the impact of its prevention policies, as well as assessing their cost-effectiveness.</p><p>\"Sadly, we see that prevention also remains poorly funded throughout Europe\", adds Anne-Marie Felton. \"This is a lost opportunity here, as over 70% of type 2 diabetes cases can be prevented or delayed by adopting healthier lifestyles.\"</p><p>The burden of diabetes in Europe is growing, with 52 million people now living with diabetes in the region. One in three adults with diabetes is undiagnosed, meaning that many people already have at least one complication by the time they are diagnosed. In 2013, about a quarter of the total expenditure for diabetes care worldwide - around 114 billion euros - was spent in Europe.</p><p><strong>Care provision under scrutiny</strong></p><p>Incomplete data and lack of proper implementation of policies have a negative impact on care provision. The report highlights vast inequalities in the availability and accessibility of screening and treatment services for diabetes-related complications, for example kidney failure and eye disease.</p><p>In the overwhelming majority of European countries, there is also an urgent need for more and better trained healthcare professionals. Diabetes nurses are a telling example. \"While the report clearly shows that diabetes nurses play an important role in diabetes care, only 19 countries give them an official status. Elsewhere, nurses do not receive specific training prior to working in diabetes care,\" says Michael Hall, honorary consultant to the International Diabetes Federation European Region.</p><p>In 20 years\\' time, estimates indicate that more than one in ten adults in Europe will have diabetes, if nothing is done to reverse the epidemic. Together with Europe\\'s ageing population, diabetes will lead to spiraling healthcare costs and place a severe strain on national health systems.</p><p>\"Inaction is clearly not an option\", adds Michael Hall. \"The first step for governments to improve diabetes care is to increase their efforts to establish national strategies for diabetes, with full implementation and regular monitoring. This would also allow for better use of resources, which is essential if countries are to build a successful response to the diabetes epidemic in Europe.\"</p> \\nWhile diabetes treatment and prevention have improved over the past years, the serious lack of proper implementation and monitoring of policies means that Europe is losing the battle against...\\n',\n",

A high glycogen content (pink) suppresses appetite and improves the management of diabetes and obesity. <br>Credit: Image: I LÃ\\x83Â³pez-Soldado, IRB Barcelona</em></div><p>The liver stores excess glucose, sugar, in the form of glycogen - chains of glucose -  which is later released to cover body energy requirements. Diabetic patients do not accumulate glucose well in the liver and this is one of the reasons why they suffer from hyperglycemia, that is to say, their blood sugar levels are too high. A study headed by Joan J. Guinovart at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) demonstrates that high hepatic glucose stores in mice prevents weigh gain. The researchers observed that in spite of having free access to an appetizing diet, the animals\\' appetite was reduced. This is the first time that a link has been observed between the liver and appetite.</p><p>On the basis of the results published in the journal <em>Diabetes</em>, the researchers argue that the stimulation of hepatic glycogen production would provide an efficient treatment to improve diabetes and obesity.</p><p>\"It is interesting to observe that what happens in the liver has direct effects on appetite. Here we reveal what occurs at the molecular level,\" explains Guinovart, head of one of the leading labs worldwide devoted to glycogen metabolism and associated diseases.</p><p>November 14 was World Diabetes Day. The incidence of diabetes and obesity is rising.  The World Health Organization estimates that 382 million people worldwide currently live with diabetes and for 2035 it forecasts that one in every 10 people will have this disease. With respect to obesity, which is closely associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes - the most common type of diabetes - the numbers are even higher. In 2008, more than 200 million men and around 300 million women were classified as obese.</p><p>\"By understanding what doesn\\'t work properly in diabetes and obesity in the molecular level, we will be closer to proposing new therapeutic targets and to finding solutions,\" explains Guinovart, although both diseases can be prevented by eating a balanced diet and exercising daily. \"In the case of type 2 diabetes, with diet alone the numbers of people with this condition would half,\" states Guinovart.</p><p>How do the liver and brain communicate with each other to regulate appetite?</p><p>The researchers questioned why mice that accumulated most glycogen in the liver did not gain weight in spite of having access to an appetising diet. In addition to observing that these animals ate less, the scientists found that the brains of these animals showed scarce appetite-stimulating molecules but rather many appetite-suppressing ones.</p><p>\"Then we finally hit on the clue - with the signal that could explain the liver-brain connection,\" explains Iliana LÃ\\x83Â³pez-Soldado, a postdoctoral researcher who has been working on these experiments for three years.  </p><p>The key to the liver-brain link is ATP, the molecule used by all living organisms to provide cells with energy and which is commonly altered in diabetes and obesity. \"We have seen that high levels of hepatic glycogen, stable levels of ATP, and high levels of appetite-suppressing molecules in the mouse brain are perfectly correlated,\" explains LÃ\\x83Â³pez-Soldado.</p> \\n\\n',\n",

But exactly how nitric oxide exerts those effects - including activation of the inflammatory factor NF-kappaB and the regulatory protein p53, which can induce the death of damaged cells - was not known. SIRT1 is known to suppress the activity of both NF-kappaB and p53, and since its dysregulation has been associated with models of several aging-related conditions, the research team focused on nitric oxide\\'s suppression of SIRT1 through a process called S-nitrosylation.</p><p>Cellular experiments revealed that S-nitrosylation inactivates SIRT1 by interfering with the protein\\'s ability to bind zinc, which in turn increases the activation of p53 and of a protein subunit of NF-kappaB.

Given that the effects of the medications are similar, why should we start patients on the expensive drugs until we\\'ve determined whether or not they respond to the less-expensive ones?\"</p><p>The newer drugs, of course, have marketing campaigns behind them - and in the case of diabetic neuropathy, their manufacturers may have sought and received specific approval for diabetic neuropathy from the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>The newer drugs have earned the highest level of recommendation in national treatment guidelines, which requires that at least 80 percent of people taking part in a clinical trial complete it in order for the study to be considered for high-level guideline approval. This helps create an artificial appearance that the newer drug is the better choice, says Callaghan.</p><p>But in fact, the trials of other medications for diabetic neuropathy had 70 percent or more completion rates, he says - not an appreciable difference.</p><p>And even though older generic drugs without a specific indication for diabetes pain must be prescribed \"off label\" by doctors, the evidence that they work is powerful - including the evidence from the new meta-analysis by the Mayo-led team.</p><p>Callaghan, who sees diabetic neuropathy patients at the U-M Health System, says he prescribes generic drugs, gabapentin or one of the tricyclic antidepressants, routinely as the first option for new pain.</p><p>The authors looked at the cost of one month of the typical starting dose for each of these medications. According to Drugstore.com, pregabalin is the most expensive at $189.98 per month, followed by duloxetine at $170.99 per month. Although venlafaxine is generic, its cost remains high at $119.98 per month. In contrast, gabapentin comes in at $18.99 per month, amitriptyline at $12.99 per month, and nortriptyline at $19.99 per month. A topical cream of capsaicin, available over the counter without a prescription, costs the least: $13.99 per month.</p><p>\"The Mayo study supports other systematic reviews on this issue,\" he says. \"We hope that adding in the cost consideration will be useful to neurologists and primary care physicians alike, since we all treat patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.\" </p> \\nSince new analysis of current evidence finds expensive and cheaper drugs both work well, doctors should consider costs until more studies are doneMillions of people with diabetes take...\\n',\n",

       " 'Deep roots likely shared by type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease\\n <p>A new study of genetic and health information from more than 15,000 women uncovered several potential ways that type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease may be related at the level of genes, proteins, and fundamental physiology.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) appear to have a lot in common. They share risk factors such as obesity and they often occur together. If they also share the same genetic underpinings, then doctors could devise a way to treat them together too. With that hope in mind, scientists applied multiple layers of analysis to the genomics of more than 15,000 women. In a new study they report finding eight molecular pathways shared in both diseases as well as several \"key driver\" genes that appear to orchestrate the gene networks in which these pathways connect and interact.</p><p>The scientists started by looking for individual genetic differences in women of three different ethnicities who had either or both of the conditions compared to similar but healthy women - a technique called a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). But the team members didn\\'t stop there. They also analyzed the women\\'s genetic differences in the context of the complex pathways in which genes and their protein products interact to affect physiology and health.</p><p>\"Looking at genes one by one is standard,\" said Dr. Simin Liu, professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Brown University School of Public Health and a co-senior author of the study published in the American Heart Association journal <em>Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics</em>. \"But ultimately, the interactions of biology are fundamentally organized in a pathway and network manner.\"</p><p>The study drew upon the genetic samples and health records of 8,155 black women, 3,494 Hispanic women and 3,697 white women gathered by the Women\\'s Health Initiative, a major research project funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. In comparing women with CVD and T2D to healthy women, lead author Kei Hang K. Chan, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Population Health and Clinical Epidemiology, and the team found key differences in eight pathways regulating cell adhesion (how cells stick within tissues), calcium signaling (how cells communicate), axon guidance (how neurons find their paths to connect with target sites), extracellular matrix (structural support within tissue), and various forms of cardiomyopathy (heart muscle problems).</p><p>These were all common across ethnicities. In addition the team found a few pathways that were ethnicity-specific between T2D and CVD.</p><p>Chan used five different methodologies to conduct these pathway analyses, reporting only those pathways that showed up as significant by at least two methods.</p><p>From there, the analysis moved further by subjecting the genes and their pathways to a network analysis to identify genes that could be \"key drivers\" of the diseases. The paper highlights a \"top ten\" list of them.</p><p>\"These [key driver] genes represent central network genes which, when perturbed, can potentially affect a large number of genes involved in the CVD and T2D pathways and thus exert stronger impact on diseases,\" wrote the authors, including co-senior author Xia Yang of the University of California-Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Potential therapeutic targets</strong></p><p>To assess whether those genes made sense as key drivers, the research team looked them up in multiple databases that researchers have compiled about the importance of the genes in the health of mouse models.</p><p>In the paper they discuss the pathways they implicate in terms of how they could reasonably relate to the disease. For example, axon guidance, normally of note in how developing fetuses build the nervous system, involves mechanisms that also happen to sustain beta cells in the pancreas, which lies at the heart of diabetes. A breakdown in that pathway could leave the cells more vulnerable, affecting the processing of sugars.</p><p>With the pathways and key driver genes identified, Liu said, there are now ample opportunities for follow-up, both to refine the understanding of the role these pathways may play in vascular health outcomes and to design and test treatments that may repair them.</p><p>\"Using a systems biology framework that integrates GWAS, pathways, gene expression, networks, and phenotypic information from both human and mouse populations, we were able to derive novel mechanistic insights and identify potential therapeutic targets,\" the researchers wrote.</p> \\nA new study of genetic and health information from more than 15,000 women uncovered several potential ways that type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease may be related at the level of genes...\\n',\n",
       " 'Diabetes and eyes: what people don\\'t know could leave them blind\\n <p>While people with diabetes are more likely to develop blinding eye diseases, recent studies have revealed low awareness of the issue among ethnicities at higher risk for diabetes and low uptake of preventive eye exams among affected Medicare beneficiaries. With the findings signaling that many Americans may not be defending themselves against diabetes-related vision loss, the American Academy of Ophthalmology is sharing information about diabetic eye disease and dilated eye exams to encourage those with diabetes to take proactive steps to protect their vision.</p><p>Although Hispanics and African-Americans are more likely to have diabetes than most other ethnicities, a recent poll commissioned by the Alliance for Eye and Vision Research has revealed that only 27 and 32 percent (respectively) report to know about diabetic eye disease.<sup>[1]</sup> In addition, while the Academy recommends that people with diabetes have a dilated eye exam every year, one study recently published in the journal Ophthalmology found that, among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma or diabetes - all conditions that require an annual eye exams - three-quarters of those who did not have an exam in five years were those living with diabetes.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>\"It\\'s alarming that so many people with diabetes or at risk for diabetes may be unaware of the damage their condition can do to their eyes and may not be getting exams to check for it,\" said Raj K. Maturi, M.D., ophthalmologist and clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. \"Outside of maintaining good blood glucose levels, having an annual dilated eye exam is the best first line defense against vision loss from diabetic eye disease.\"</p><p>While \"diabetic eye disease\" is often used, people may be unaware that this term encompasses a number of diseases and conditions that can cause blindness if left untreated. These include:</p><p>Diabetic Retinopathy affects 28.5 percent of people age 40 and older living with diabetes.<sup>[3]</sup> It occurs when the small blood vessels in the eye change by swelling, leaking fluid or closing off completely, blocking blood flow from reaching the retina. In its earliest stages, diabetic retinopathy does not have symptoms, but can lead to changes in the eye, such as macular edema, which is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetes. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy and many of its related changes include laser surgery, medical injections and vitrectomy surgery in which blood and scar tissue caused by abnormal blood vessels is removed.</p><p>Cataract occurs when the eye\\'s lens becomes cloudy, causing vision to become blurry, cloudy or dim. While this happens in many people as they age, those with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts than their peers without diabetes. Mild cataracts may be treated with eyeglasses, but once the cataract is advanced, it will require cataract surgery, in which the natural cloudy lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens implant known as an intraocular lens or IOL.</p><p>Glaucoma is a disease that damages the optic nerve and peripheral vision. The damage to the optic nerve is usually caused by elevated pressure in the eye. People with diabetes are also more likely to develop glaucoma, which rarely has any noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Glaucoma can be treated with medication such as prescription eye drops or with surgery, but will result in blindness if left untreated.</p><p>The Academy recommends that those with those with type 2 diabetes should get a dilated eye exam at the time of diagnosis and every year following. Those with type 1 diabetes should start receiving annual eye exams five years after their initial diagnosis.</p><p>Seniors who have not had a recent eye exam or for whom cost is a concern may qualify for EyeCare America, a program of the Foundation of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, that offers eye exams and care at no out-of-pocket cost for eligible seniors age 65 and older.

       " 'Potential new class of drug to fight diabetes\\n <p>The growing epidemic of obesity across the world is associated with an equivalent increase in type-2 diabetes, which results from the body\\'s ineffective use of insulin. Obese people often develop inflammation in their fat tissue, which, in turn, can reduce the sensitivity of fat cells to insulin, resulting in type-2 diabetes. EPFL scientists, working with researchers from Italy and the Netherlands, have shown that bile acids activate a little-known receptor to overcome the loss of insulin sensitivity, forming the basis for a new class of drug against type-2 diabetes. The work is published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Investigation</em>.</p><p>Diabetes develops when the body has problems with insulin, a hormone that regulates sugar levels in the blood. This results either because the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin or when the body cannot use insulin efficiently. There are two types of diabetes: type 1, which usually starts at young age, and type 2, which accounts for 90% of all diabetics and is generally caused by obesity.</p><p>One of the major problems of type-2 diabetes is that it often coincides with chronic inflammation in the body\\'s fat tissue. This inflammation arises from the activity of immune cells called macrophages within the fat tissue, which recruit even more macrophages through chemical signals. The accumulation of macrophages interferes with the ability of fat cells to respond appropriately to insulin; this condition is known as \"insulin resistance\". Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are urgently searching for treatments that can minimize the accumulation of macrophages in fat tissue.</p><p>A research team led by Kristina Schoonjans at EPFL has discovered that a receptor located on macrophages can inhibit the inflammation of type-2 diabetes. Receptors are proteins that bind chemicals and initiate cascades of events in the cell. The macrophage receptor in this study is called TGR5, and is activated by chemicals in our bile, collectively referred to as \"bile acids\".</p><p>Bile acids have traditionally been thought to be restricted to the small intestine, helping with the digestion of lipids. But recent studies - many led by Schoonjans - have shown that bile acids also enter the bloodstream and behave like hormones, acting on receptors like TGR5, and affecting the behavior of different types of cells.</p><p>The researchers found that TGR5 can block the chemical signals macrophages send to attract more of their number into fat tissue. When they activated the receptor with compounds that were similar to bile acids, TGR5 triggered a molecular cascade in the cells that reduced the accumulation of macrophages, significantly minimizing the inflammation associated with type-2 diabetes.</p><p>This discovery opens a new way for addressing inflammation in type-2 diabetes. Molecules that can mimic the effect of bile acids on macrophage TGR5 can become new anti-obesity and diabetes drugs. \"Of course, we don\\'t want to use bile acids for treatment of diabetes,\" says Alessia Perino who is the lead author on the study. \"We are very interested in finding molecules that can mimic the effects of bile acids, and we have already discovered several small molecules that can do that.\"</p> \\nThe growing epidemic of obesity across the world is associated with an equivalent increase in type-2 diabetes, which results from the body\\'s ineffective use of insulin.\\n',\n",

The condition can often be managed through a change in diet, increasing exercise and maintaining a healthy weight, although some patients may require diabetes medication - such as metformin - or insulin therapy.</p><p><strong>The most common symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents include increased thirst and urination, fatigue and weight loss.

But despite an increase in diabetes prevalence among children and adolescents, it seems there is a lack of awareness when it comes to identifying symptoms of the condition. </p><h2>Only 14% of parents can identify the four main symptoms of diabetes</h2><p>According to a 2012 survey from leading UK charity Diabetes UK, only 9% of parents were able to identify the four main symptoms of type 1 diabetes. A more recent survey from the charity found that this percentage had increased to 14%.</p><p>But according to Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, this is far from good enough:</p><blockquote><p>\"In too many cases, children with type 1 diabetes are not diagnosed until they are seriously ill, and in a few tragic cases, this delay in diagnosis can even be fatal.\"</p></blockquote><p><strong>Young is not wrong. Children with a delayed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes - and very rarely, a delayed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes - can develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). It is the leading cause of mortality in children with type 1 diabetes.</strong></p><p>If the body experiences a serious lack of insulin, it is unable to use glucose for energy. As a result, the body begins to break down other tissues for energy, which leads to the production of poisonous chemicals called ketones. A build-up of these chemicals causes DKA, in which the body becomes acidic.</p><p>If diabetes is diagnosed early and managed effectively, DKA is highly preventable. Unfortunately, however, this does not happen often enough.</p><h2>Doctors failing to identify diabetes in children</h2><p>It is not only parents who may be blind to diabetes symptoms among children. Earlier this year, researchers from the UK warned that many health professionals also fail to identify the signs of the condition and are putting children\\'s lives at risk.</p><p>In a study published in the journal <em>Archives of Disease in Childhood</em>, researchers analyzed 261 children aged between 8 months and 16 years who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Symptoms leading up to their diagnosis were assessed.</p><p><strong>The researchers found that by the time children under the age of 2 years were clinically diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, 80% of them had already developed DKA.</strong></p><p>Study co-author Dr. Kemi Lokulo-Sodipe, a research fellow at Southampton Children\\'s Hospital in the UK, comments:</p><blockquote><p>\"When symptomatic children with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes had multiple contacts with health professionals, they were more likely to present with DKA and this is very concerning, as we know early diagnosis is essential to enable treatment with insulin and avoid complications.\"</p></blockquote><p>A 2008 study, published in the journal <em>Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism</em>, found that among 335 children under the age of 17 with new-onset type 1 diabetes, the initial diagnosis was incorrect in more than 16% of cases.</p><p>The study revealed that among these cases, doctors initially diagnosed 46.3% of children with a respiratory system infection, while others received a diagnosis of perineal candidiasis (16.6%), gastroenteritis (16.6%), urinary tract infection (11.1%), stomatitis (11.1%) or appendicitis (3.7%).</p><p>Furthermore, the researchers found that incidence of DKA was more frequent among children who received an incorrect - and therefore delayed - diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.</p><p><strong>Although children and adolescents with diabetes usually experience four main symptoms, Young notes that having all four symptoms is \"the exception rather than the rule,\" noting that many children may only have one or two. In some cases, no symptoms will appear.</strong></p><p>As such, a child suddenly becoming more thirsty or tired may not ring diabetes alarm bells for a parent. And because diabetes is much rarer among very young children, doctors may attribute any  symptoms to other, more common illnesses.</p><h2>The \\'4 Ts\\'</h2><p>So what can be done to ensure that children who have symptoms of diabetes are diagnosed early and receive adequate treatment?</p><p><strong>\"As a nation, we need to emphasize that diabetes is common and the incidence is increasing,\" says Dr. Lokulo-Sodipe. \"It can present in babies and young children and it should be at the top of the list in any child with increased toileting  - including heavy wet nappies and bedwetting - but also weight loss and fatigue.\"</strong></p><p>In 2012, Diabetes UK launched the \"4 Ts\" campaign - aimed at increasing awareness of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes that children may experience.</p><p>Campaigns that aim to increase awareness of child diabetes symptoms have proved successful in the past. A 2012 study, published in the journal <em>Pediatric Diabetes</em>, revealed that during such a campaign in Australia, the rate of DKA at initial diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children reduced by 64%.</p><p>The 4 Ts that Diabetes UK say people should be aware of in children are:</p><ul><li><strong>T</strong>oilet - using the toilet frequently, heavier nappies in babies or bedwetting from a previously dry child</li><li><strong>T</strong>hirsty - drinking more fluids than usual but being unable to quench thirst</li><li><strong>T</strong>ired - feeling more tired than usual</li><li><strong>T</strong>hinner - weight loss.</li></ul><p>A video providing more information on the 4 Ts can be viewed below:</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9suitCY2fsw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>The organization says that if a child is showing any of the 4 Ts, parents should take them to the doctor straight away and insist on an immediate type 1 diabetes test. This consists of a finger-prick test in which the child\\'s blood is analyzed to determine their glucose level.</strong></p><p>Young says:</p><blockquote><p>\"As well as making parents and those who look after and work with children aware of the symptoms, we need to increase understanding that a child who has any of the 4 Ts needs to be tested straight away. </p><p>This is because onset can be so quick that a delay of a matter of hours can be the difference between being diagnosed at the right time and being diagnosed too late.\"</p></blockquote><p>This month is American Diabetes Month, an annual campaign that aims to raise awareness of diabetes among the general population.

That means remembering to change the alarm clock next to the bed, which will mean an extra hour of sleep before getting up in the morning.</p><p>But for some diabetics who use insulin pumps, Saleh Aldasouqi, associate professor of medicine at Michigan State University, suggests that remembering to change the time on this device should be the priority.</p><p>\"Some diabetes patients who use insulin pumps may forget to change the clock that is found in these devices,\" said diabetes expert Aldasouqi. \"Forgetting to change the time can result in insulin dosing errors that can be harmful.\"</p><p>His article can be found in the November issue of the <em>Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology.</em></p><p>Dosing errors could cause too little or too much insulin being delivered at the right time for these patients.</p><p>Too much insulin produces hypoglycemia, which could be severe and trigger seizures, fainting spells or coma. Hyperglycemia is a result of too little insulin being delivered and in the short term isn\\'t as harmful as hypoglycemia. Early effects of hyperglycemia may include tiredness and frequent urination, yet longer-term effects could cause the body to become acidic, known as diabetic ketoacidosis, and could also produce life-threatening complications.</p><p>Aldasouqi said he\\'s had a number of patients come into his office who have forgotten to make the time change or in other cases, haven\\'t adjusted the clock after changing the pump battery. He\\'s also come across additional issues in his research such as health providers finding incorrect a.m. and p.m. settings.</p><p>\"At this point, I haven\\'t seen a fatal error occur, but why wait?\" he said. \"That\\'s why it\\'s important to raise awareness about this issue now and encourage physicians and patients alike to make sure these clocks are set up correctly at all times.\"</p><p>There are two forms of insulin delivery methods, basal and bolus. Basal insulin therapy helps patients with diabetes control blood sugar in steady amounts throughout the day and night, while bolus therapy releases insulin in bursts around meals.</p><p>A major concern is those receiving the bolus therapy may be affected more significantly if timing is off.</p><p>\"Since this delivery method is timed around meals, if a patient eats lunch around noon, they\\'ll get their burst of insulin at the wrong time,\" he said. \"If it\\'s too much or too little, it could send them to the hospital or worse.\"</p><p>Currently, insulin pump technology lags behind and doesn\\'t have clocks that automatically adjust. GPS technology could be used to help solve this problem, but is considered controversial due to privacy concerns.</p><p>For now, Aldasouqi said the responsibility is on the patient and also on the medical community to educate patients and make sure pumps are set correctly.</p><p>\"The implications of remembering to change the clock in these devices means so much more than just remembering to adjust the alarm clock for that extra hour of sleep,\" he said. \"As a physician, I\\'m going to do what I can to make sure patients are safe.\"</p> \\nWe turn back the hands of time as part of the twice-annual ritual of daylight saving time once again.\\n',\n",

       " 'A link discovered between pulmonary hypertension, diabetes and cancer\\n <p>A UAlberta team has discovered that a protein that plays a critical role in metabolism, the process by which the cell generates energy from foods, is important for the development of pulmonary hypertension, a deadly disease.</p><p>Pulmonary hypertension is caused by the narrowing of the blood vessels in the lung, due to excessive growth of cells in the blood vessel wall. The cells grow in number until they obstruct the vessels, causing the heart to struggle pushing blood through the lungs to the point where the heart fails and the patient dies.</p><p>Evangelos Michelakis, a professor in the Department of Medicine and senior author of the study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, says in a sense, the cells grow uncontrollably, resembling cancer cells, with which they share many molecular features. He adds that many patients with pulmonary hypertension, without being obese or diabetic, have features of insulin resistance, as if they were diabetic. Those links with cancer and diabetes have puzzled researchers trying to understand what causes pulmonary hypertension in order to develop much needed therapies.</p><p>\"We may have an answer to that,\" says Michelakis. \"Our previous work had suggested that mitochondria, the organelles in the cell that regulate metabolism, are involved in the development of pulmonary hypertension, but we did not know exactly how. We also knew that mitochondria are involved in the development of both cancer and diabetes.\"</p><p>\"So we looked at a key regulator of mitochondrial function, a protein called Sirtuin3,\" says Roxane Paulin, a postdoctoral fellow in Michelakis\\' laboratory and first author of the study. \"We found that in lab models of pulmonary hypertension and, more importantly, in tissues from 160 patients, Sirtuin3 was present in lower amounts and was less active in lab models and patients with pulmonary hypertension than in those without the disease. We were intrigued to find that lab models that just lacked Sirtuin 3, developed pulmonary hypertension. The same models have been shown by other researchers to develop diabetes and cancer.\"</p><p>Michelakis believes that although there is still much work that needs to be done, this is the first proof of a link between pulmonary hypertension, cancer and diabetes. \"This work offers strong support to the theory that pulmonary hypertension has a metabolic basis and may facilitate our efforts to diagnose and treat the disease.\"</p><p>\"When we used gene therapy to deliver the missing Sirtuin 3 to the lungs of lab models of pulmonary hypertension with an inhaled virus, we found that the disease improved significantly two weeks later, opening the possibility for similar gene therapy approaches to patients,\" says Paulin.</p><p>Michelakis adds, \"The fact that we found a variant Sirtuin 3 gene that produces a defective Sirtuin 3 protein, (which has also been found in patients with metabolic syndrome, a form of diabetes) in the blood cells of many patients with pulmonary hypertension, suggests that it may be easy to identify the precise patients that may benefit from gene therapy the future.\"</p> \\nA UAlberta team has discovered that a protein that plays a critical role in metabolism, the process by which the cell generates energy from foods, is important for the development of pulmonary...\\n',\n",

An independent cross-site evaluation of the five-site community-based care initiative involving African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans showed statistically significant decreases in blood glucose measures, increased quality of life, and decreased health care use and cost for patients with diabetes in the Alliance program.</p><p>\"A key element of the Alliance model is that it allows the sites freedom to address underlying gaps and weaknesses in its current health care system - a sharp contrast to traditional medical models,\" says co-guest editor of the supplement Dr. Leonard Jack, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Diabetes affects nearly 26 million people in the United States, with racial/ethnic populations disproportionately affected.

It was published online by the peer-reviewed journal <em>Clinical Chemistry </em>and will be published in the journal\\'s January 2015 special print issue, \"Molecular Diagnostics: A Revolution in Progress.\"</p><p>\"If we can define the boundaries of molecular targets in saliva, then we can ask what the constituents in saliva are that can mark someone who has pre-diabetes or the early stages of oral cancer or pancreatic cancer - and we can utilize this knowledge for personalized medicine,\" said Dr. David Wong, a senior author of the research and UCLA\\'s Felix and Mildred Yip Endowed Professor in Dentistry.</p><p>Wong said the test also holds promise for diagnosing Type 2 diabetes, gastric cancer and other diseases. \"If you don\\'t look in saliva, you may miss important indicators of disease,\" Wong said. \"There seems to be treasure in saliva, which will surprise people.\"</p><p>RNA, widely known as a cellular messenger that makes proteins and carries out DNA\\'s instructions to other parts of the cell, is now understood to perform sophisticated chemical reactions and is believed to perform an extraordinary number of other functions, at least some of which are unknown.</p><p>Wong\\'s research over the past decade has focused on identifying biomarkers in saliva. His laboratory discovered that some of the same RNA that is inside human cells are also present in saliva and can be used to detect diseases - a surprising finding, he said, because enzymes in saliva can degrade RNA, making the mouth \"a hostile environment.\"</p><p>The new research is a collaboration with Xinshu (Grace) Xiao, the paper\\'s other senior author and a UCLA associate professor of integrative biology and physiology. Using state-of-the-science genomics and bioinformatics, the researchers analyzed 165 million genetic sequences.</p><p>Among the many forms of RNA are some unusual ones that live in the mouth and in cells. For example, it wasn\\'t known until very recently that RNA comes in a circular form; the linear form has long been known. But the UCLA scientists identified more than 400 circular RNAs in human saliva - the first discovery of circular RNA in saliva or any body fluid - including 327 forms that were previously unknown.</p><p>Circular RNA\\'s function in saliva is not entirely understood, although it does serve as a sponge for tiny RNA molecules called microRNAs, which bind to it.</p><p>\"Circular RNAs in saliva may be protecting other RNAs,\" said Xiao, who also is a faculty member in the UCLA College and a member of UCLA\\'s Molecular Biology Institute. It\\'s likely, she said, that circular RNAs in saliva protect microRNAs from being degraded.</p><p>MicroRNAs, which once seemed to be little more than molecular noise, play important roles in many cell types, and have been implicated in cancers and other diseases, Xiao said. One microRNA can regulate hundreds of genes, she said.</p><p>The scientists compared microRNA levels in saliva to those in the blood and other body fluids, and found the levels of microRNA in blood and in saliva are very similar - indicating that a saliva sample would be a good measure of microRNAs in the body.</p><p>They also found that saliva contains another class of small RNAs, called piwi-interacting RNAs, or piRNAs, which are produced by stem cells, skin cells and germ cells. There are very few piRNAs in blood and most other body fluids, but Xiao\\'s analysis showed that piRNA are abundant in saliva. Although their function is not yet known, Xiao said they may protect the body from viral infection.</p><p>While most RNA molecules translate genetic code from DNA to make proteins, there is also a class called non-coding RNAs that does not.</p><p>\"Saliva carries with it non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, piRNAs and circRNAs that are biomarkers for disease and health monitoring,\" said Wong, who also is associate dean of research at the UCLA School of Dentistry. \"Had we not done this collaboration, we would never know that non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, piRNAs and circRNAs exist in saliva.\"</p><p>Their overriding conclusion is that saliva has tremendous medical and scientific value. In the not-too-distant future, dentists might be able to take saliva samples to analyze for a variety of diseases.

       " 'New tool helps make sense of previous genetic data on multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, other diseases\\n <p>Scores of autoimmune diseases afflicting one in 12 Americans - ranging from type 1 diabetes, to multiple sclerosis (MS), to rheumatoid arthritis, to asthma - mysteriously cause the immune system to harm tissues within our own bodies. Now, a new study pinpoints the complex genetic origins for many of these diseases, a discovery that may lead to better diagnosis and ultimately to improved treatments.</p><p>A team of scientists from UC San Francisco, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Yale School of Medicine developed a new mathematical tool to more deeply probe existing DNA databases. In so doing they discovered how certain DNA variations, when inherited, are likely to contribute to disease.</p><p>By applying their method to analyzing data from previous studies of 21 different autoimmune diseases, the research team has deepened scientific understanding of the genetic underpinnings of a wide range of these disorders. They also found the specific immune cells most responsible for the diseases. Their study is published online in <em>Nature.</em></p><p>The researchers examined a wealth of data from 39 large-scale studies called genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Teams of scientists in recent years have conducted GWAS - typically enlisting thousands of study participants - to identify large blocks of DNA within the human genome within which genetic variants are implicated as risk factors for common diseases. But examination of GWAS data to date has seldom pointed to altered proteins, as surprisingly few protein-encoding gene variants within these broad swaths of DNA have been associated with the diseases under investigation.</p><p>Instead, the genetic risks identified through GWAS more often appear to be associated with DNA variations that do not reside within genes. The nature of this risk has defied understanding until now, fueling a perception that few medical benefits have thus far emerged from large-scale studies of human genetic variation being conducted in the wake of the initial Human Genome Project.</p><p>In the new study the researchers found that the presence of specific genetic variants in different autoimmune diseases can alter patterns of activity of genes in particular ways that affect functions of the immune system. This was true despite the fact that the genetic variants are not within genes.</p><p>To make their discoveries, the researchers developed software and used next-generation sequencing techniques to probe \"epigenetic\" characteristics of specialized immune cells, in which gene activity is affected without changes to the DNA sequence itself within the affected genes.</p><p>The team discovered that a majority of key DNA changes associated with autoimmune diseases occur in functional bits of DNA known as \"enhancers.\"</p><p>Although DNA exists within cells as long, stringy molecules, DNA can bend back upon itself with the support of the chromosome\\'s structural proteins, so that one piece of DNA may interact with another. Enhancers fold in this way to bind to DNA switches that turn genes on. In general the enhancers identified in the <em>Nature</em> study as playing a role in autoimmune disease were DNA sequences that did not match DNA-sequence motifs previously thought to be essential to enhancers, and had not previously been seen as having any functional role.</p><p>\"Once again, research is revealing new meaning in the world of DNA once thought of as junk - short, seemingly random DNA sequences that in fact serve meaningful roles in human physiology,\" said Alex Marson, MD, PhD, UCSF Sandler Faculty Fellow and the corresponding author for the study.</p><p>By painstakingly mapping enhancers in specialized immune cells, and by tracking down patterns of altered gene activation that resulted from the presence of variants found in GWAS studies, the researchers identified patterns of activity within the genome and cell types associated with the autoimmune diseases. Many autoimmune diseases were associated with immune cells known as T helpers. The authors suggest that genetic variation may be tuning the response of these key immune cells to stimuli within their surroundings to increase the risk of autoimmunity.</p><p>Marson initiated the scientific collaboration while he was an MD/PhD student at Harvard and MIT and a medical resident at the Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, joining together with the senior scientists for the study: Bradley Bernstein, MD, PhD, associate member of Broad Institute and professor of pathology at Harvard, and David A. Hafler, MD, professor of neurology and immunobiology, and chair of the Department of Neurology at Yale. Marson and Kyle Kai-How Farh, MD, PhD, a clinical geneticist and postdoctoral fellow with the Broad Institute, are co-first authors of the <em>Nature</em> article.</p><p>Among other revelations, the new study strongly links the cause of MS to the immune system, not to genetic variants associated with the nervous system. According to Hafler, the results provide definitive evidence that MS is an autoimmune disease, and that the immune system plays the primary role. \"This is highly consistent with the new multiple sclerosis treatments that work on the immune system, suggesting that we finally have a good handle as to the underlying causes of MS,\" Hafler said.</p><p>The new ability to associate specific genetic variants on one hand with cell circuits that control gene activity and alter the physiology of specific immune cell types on the other will enable medical researchers to more precisely target therapeutic interventions in autoimmune diseases in order to dampen aberrantly fired-up immune responses, according to Marson.</p><p>In his UCSF lab, Marson intends to probe more deeply how these newly identified DNA variants in enhancers affect cells, and how their disease-causing effects might be mitigated by DNA manipulations carried out using gene-editing technologies known as CRISPR.</p> \\nScores of autoimmune diseases afflicting one in 12 Americans - ranging from type 1 diabetes, to multiple sclerosis (MS), to rheumatoid arthritis, to asthma - mysteriously cause the immune system...\\n',\n",

The report challenges the conventional approach to health policy-making, which has historically addressed infectious diseases and noncommunicable (or \"chronic\") diseases independently.</p><p>  Diabetes triples the risk that a person will develop tuberculosis. Diabetes is skyrocketing globally, projected to increase from 382 million cases in 2013 to 592 cases in 2035, with the burden of disease moving from developed countries into developing and emerging-market countries. Unless steps are taken to halt the trend, the consequence will be an increasing number of people who develop tuberculosis as a result of diabetes; potentially reversing the progress made against TB over the last few decades. An estimated 1.5 million people died of tuberculosis in 2013, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p> \"Ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky was so successful due to his playing strategy.

The key is to prevent this from happening.\"</p><p> \"We saw something similar happen with TB and HIV/AIDS to what is happening now with TB and diabetes,\" said Dr. Anthony Harries, Senior Advisor to The Union. \"For years we had medical evidence that the two diseases were working together as HIV destroyed people\\'s immune systems, allowing TB to quadruple in many countries in Africa.

       " 'Diabetic foot ulcers may be healed by new drug delivered through skin patch\\n <p><strong>Targeted therapeutic agent increases a needed protein in diabetic patients, potentially preventing foot amputations</strong></p><p>A foot ulcer is typically a painful inconvenience to most people, but to a person with diabetes it could mean an infection, or worse, an amputation. But a research team at Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, Calif., has developed a drug delivered through a skin patch that not only helps foot wounds heal better, but also prevents those wounds from recurring, according to study results they presented this week at the American College of Surgeons Annual Clinical Congress.</p><p>Amputations are one of the most serious complications of diabetes. About 29.1 million Americans are living with diabetes. Among adults who have lower-limb amputations unrelated to trauma, about 60 percent have been diagnosed with diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Geoffrey Gurtner, MD, FACS, the Johnson and Johnson Professor of Surgery and associate chairman of surgery for research at Stanford University School of Medicine, said that foot ulcers are a major reason why people with diabetes end up needing foot amputations. However, even after that operation, many diabetes patients fare worse.</p><p>\"It\\'s not just having your leg surgically removed,\" says Dr. Gurtner, a study coauthor. \"An amputation sends these patients into a downward spiral where they are not active. Then, all the other health issues that accompany inactivity come into play. A diabetic patient who undergoes an amputation has a 50 percent five-year mortality, which is worse than breast cancer or Hodgkin\\'s disease.\"</p><p>Foot ulcers are particularly dangerous for people with diabetes because the impaired blood flow prevents the wound from healing properly. \"You can clear out blockages of the big blood vessels with stents or bypasses,\" Dr. Gurtner explained \"but that treatment only solves half the problem.\"</p><p>In addition to blocked blood vessels, the blood sugar toxicity in people with diabetes impairs a protein, called hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1Ã\\x8eÂ±). This protein turns on the genes that help form new networks of small blood vessels needed to heal damaged tissue. \"At the microcirculation level, the small capillaries are the final distribution for blood, oxygen, and nutrients to tissue,\" Dr. Gurtner said.</p><p>With that mechanism in mind, Dr. Gurtner and his colleagues developed a drug that increases the protein HIF-1Ã\\x8eÂ± in diabetes patients. The drug\\'s main ingredient is another medication that has been available for more than 60 years, called deferoxamine.</p><p>But the drug\\'s molecules are too large to penetrate the skin adequately. \"If you just put it on the skin, it won\\'t get through,\" Dr. Gurtner said. \"So, we needed to develop a transdermal patch to serve as the drug\\'s delivery tool.\"</p><p>The Stanford research team tested both methods using a human skin apparatus. Their results showed that the patch had several advantages over a topical solution: The wound healed 14 days faster, and it boosted the quality of the wound healing by improving the damaged skin\\'s collagen levels.</p><p>These advantages also help to solve another problem: \"If you have a diabetic foot ulcer, you have a 50 percent chance of it re-ulcerating within a year,\" Dr. Gurtner said.</p><p>Because the patch helps the skin heal better, there\\'s a chance that this could prevent repeat ulcers, and maybe even the initial ulcers too.</p><p>\"We have lots of diagnostic modalities to tell patients their feet are at risk for a wound by how much oxygen is getting to the skin, blood flow, and which areas are at risk,\" Dr. Gurtner explained. \"But, when we find that there\\'s low oxygen or delivery of blood, there\\'s not much we can do except tell the person to take better care of their feet. This drug could actually change the biology of diabetic patients.\"</p><p>The next step to bring the drug to market is a clinical trial testing the drug with diabetes patients who are at risk for foot ulcers. \"Once we prove that it works, I could see this drug one day becoming the first line of treatment for diabetic ulcers and preventative foot care,\" Dr. Gurtner concluded.</p> \\nTargeted therapeutic agent increases a needed protein in diabetic patients, potentially preventing foot amputationsA foot ulcer is typically a painful inconvenience to most people, but to a...\\n',\n",

They found: </p><ul><li>    Patients who said their doctor was practicing more like a medical home (such as having more accessible hours and making sure that patients see the same doctor at each visit) had better health-related quality of life. </li><li>    For every 25 percent increase in medical home performance, patients reported an improvement in health that can be compared to eliminating one of the early complications of diabetes - vascular disease.   </li><li>  The effect was strongest for women, with improvements in health that can be compared to eliminating diabetic retinopathy (vision problems). Women tend to ask more questions of their doctors and may benefit more from doctors who are more available to them.</li></ul><p>Given that diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and is one of the most expensive chronic conditions, improving health outcomes for type 2 diabetes patients in a cost-effective way is a top priority for insurers including Medicare and Medicaid that see a disproportionate share of patients with diabetes. The USC-led study shows that doctors don\\'t have to rely on expensive technology or new drugs to greatly improve the health of patients with diabetes. Instead, they can offer more patient-friendly hours, take time to learn about their patients, and help coordinate referrals.</p><p>\"I think primary care doctors have the tools they need to deliver more patient-focused care,\" said Stevens, the principal investigator on the study \"But our country also needs to support their efforts by training more primary care doctors in this model, rewarding doctors who adopt it, and ultimately reducing the incredible time pressure on doctors.\"</p> \\nA new model of delivering primary care studied by Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC) researchers has the potential to improve the health of patients with type 2...\\n',\n",
       " 'New insights into the development of ciliopathies\\n <p>Diseases of the sensory or motile cilia play a key role in lung diseases or diabetes. Scientists at Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ\\x83Â¼nchen have now discovered the protein Flattop. It regulates the asymmetric positioning of cilia. Malfunctions in this process lead to different clinical phenotypes.</p><p>To date, it is still not clear how proteins regulate planar cell polarity (PCP) or the positioning of the basal body (BB) and cilia. Scientists of Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ\\x83Â¼nchen have now taken an important step in elucidating this mechanism. Moritz Gegg and Professor Dr. Heiko Lickert of the Institute of Diabetes and Regeneration Research (IDR) have published their new findings in the journal <em>eLIFE</em>.</p><p>\"Epithelial cell layers line all of the inner and outer body and organ surfaces in the human body, for example in the lung, intestine, pancreas and in the inner ear,\" said Moritz Gegg. Cilia - small, hair-like, microtubule-based structures - project from BBs and are precisely positioned on many of these epithelial cells. \"Only through this exact positioning can cilia movements be coordinated so precisely that for example mucus can be transported from the lung or sound can be perceived from sensory inner ear hair cells,\" added Heiko Lickert. </p><p>Cilia are anchored by the basal bodies to the plasma membrane and like many other organelles must be localized to a specific position in a cell. To ensure this, the PCP machinery goes into action. It orients organelles in single cells, but also determines the position of these cells within the plane of an epithelial layer. A complete loss of this cell polarity machinery can lead to very severe developmental disorders, such as chronic bronchitis, deafness or other birth defects. </p><p>Several proteins assist in the formation of this cell polarity machinery by influencing the orientation of the intracellular cytoskeleton. Thus, a complex of PCP proteins can coordinate the localization of individual organelles and cells in the epithelial cell assembly. Although many proteins that regulate these processes are already known, scientists have wondered for a long time how both systems interact with each other to acquire planar cell polarity.</p><p>\"We showed in the preclinical model that a protein which we have called Flattop (Fltp), together with another protein called Dlg3, positions the basal body and thus the cilia,\" Gegg said. Models without a functional Fltp show a defect in cilia formation on the surface of the lung epithelium. Moreover, the cilia in the inner ear were not correctly localized. \"Fltp and Dlg3 interact in the inner ear physically with each other,\" said Lickert. Both also interact with one of the core planar cell polarity genes. This protein complex surrounds the basal body and connects it with the cytoskeleton. </p><p>Lickert: \"This discovery leads to a better understanding of basal body and cilia positioning. A dysregulation of cilia formation and function leads to a wide spectrum of diseases in human, i.e. ciliopathies such as diabetes, chronic lung diseases, deafness and also cancer.\" Fltp could also be dysfunctional in patients with lung diseases. Loss of this protein leads to defects of the sensory cells in the inner ear. In addition, there are indications that Fltp regulates cell division in the intestine. Gegg: \"Further studies are needed to elucidate exactly how the protein complex consisting of Fltp, Dlg3, the core PCP proteins and the basal body proteins interacts with the cytoskeleton. In addition, the important question needs to be clarified to what extent this protein complex also fulfills a similar function in other epithelial cell types.\"</p> \\nDiseases of the sensory or motile cilia play a key role in lung diseases or diabetes.

Berkowitz, M.D., M.P.H., of Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and colleagues examined the initial choice of a glucose-lowering medication on the time to subsequent treatment intensification, as well as hypoglycemia, diabetes-related emergency department visits or cardiovascular events. The authors used data from a group of 15,516 patients who were insured and had been prescribed an oral glucose-lowering medication from July 2009 through June 2013.</p><p> Of those patients, 8,964 patients (57.8 percent) began diabetes treatment with metformin.

Think carefully about how you will eat that day, and what you want to achieve. Sign and date the contract, put it on your refrigerator - and stick to it!</li><li>Plan your plate:</li><ul><li>Fill half of your plate with veggies, such as carrots, green beans or broccoli.</li><li>Fill one-quarter with starches (carbs) such as sweet potatoes, mashed or baked potatoes, rice pilaf or quinoa.</li><li>Fill one-quarter with lean meat, such as turkey or chicken. Try to avoid dark meat and remove any skin from your meat before eating. If you must have gravy, use just a little.</li></ul><li>Go easy on the alcohol: From office parties to New Year\\'s toasts, alcohol is everywhere during this time of year. Before you drink, check with your doctor to be sure it is safe. Alcohol can interfere with some medications, including insulin. If your doctor tells you not to drink alcohol, sip a sparkling water with a lime twist. If it\\'s OK to drink, go easy. Have one glass of wine per party, and skip the mixed drinks, which have more carbs. Or have a spritzer - half sparkling water, half wine. It is important to eat when drinking alcohol to avoid low blood sugar.</li></ul><p><strong>Being Active: It may be difficult to fit in your normal routine. But there are ways to keep moving and have fun:</strong></p><ul><li>Get everyone off the couch: Instead of dozing after a big meal, plan a family game. Tag, flag football and Wii&trade; are all activities that will get everyone up and moving. Or suggest a walk with a family member whom you rarely see. It\\'s a great way to work off calories, reconnect, and can help lower your blood sugar levels.</li><li>Run for fun: Sign up for a local holiday run or walk with your family or friends. You could even make it a healthy tradition.</li><li>Volunteer: Seek opportunities in your area to help at a church, charity, soup kitchen or shelter that may need extra support during the holidays. Call to find out how you can help. The experience can be rewarding while also keeping you active.</li></ul><p><strong>Healthy Coping and Reducing Risks:</strong></p><ul><li>If you\\'re traveling, bring extra medications - Gone for a week? Pack two weeks\\' worth of your diabetes medications in case of travel delays or lost supplies. This includes insulin, syringes, testing strips, insulin pump supplies, a first-aid kit, glucagon emergency kit, etc. Have a prescription from your doctor for insulin or oral medication in case of an emergency. If you are traveling by air, keep your medications and supplies with you at all times.</li><li>Find time to unwind. Even with routines you may find yourself getting tired or cranky. This can be a sign of normal holiday stress. Find time to relax. Unwind with a cup of tea or sneak away to read a chapter or two of your favorite book.

       " 'Studies must be carried out to determine whether exercise slows the onset of type 1 diabetes in children and adults\\n <p>Rates of type 1 diabetes - the autoimmune form of the condition that often begins in childhood and eventually results in lifelong dependency on insulin - are increasing in almost all nations worldwide. However, while it appears possible from research in other forms of diabetes that physical exercise could slow the progression of this disease, there have been no studies to date that explore this in patients with type 1 diabetes. In a paper published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes) researchers argue that such trials must be carried out to potentially benefit the millions of people affected by type 1 diabetes worldwide.</p><p>In the UK, approximately 0.3% of the population (or 1 in 300 to 350 people) is affected by type 1 diabetes. It is characterised by immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It is mostly diagnosed during childhood or young adulthood. Eventually, the body can no longer produce enough insulin to adequately deal with increases in blood sugar, meaning the person must at some point begin injecting insulin and continue doing so for the rest of their life. \"However, significant beta cell function is usually still present at the time of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and preservation of this function has important clinical benefits,\" says paper co-author Dr Parth Narendran, of the Institute of Biomedical Research, The Medical School, University of Birmingham, UK. \"The last 30 years have seen a number of largely unsuccessful trials for beta cell preservation, and with therapies that have potential for harm. There is a need to explore new more tolerable approaches to preserving beta cell function, and ones that can be implemented on a large clinical scale. Exercise could be an ideal example of such an approach,\" he adds.</p><p>Research has shown that preserving beta cell function reduces rates of complications including retinopathy (that can lead to blindness) and neuropathy (pain and numbness related to impaired nerve function), as well as decreasing the chances of hypoglycaemia (episodes of dangerously low blood sugar that can be fatal).</p><p>In this paper, the authors discuss the evidence to back new large-scale trials of exercise in type 1 diabetes. Physical exercise elicits marked elevations in circulating levels of key molecules such as growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 receptor agonist (IL-1ra), all of which are thought to have a preserving effect on beta cell mass. Furthermore, exercise decreases levels of harmful inflammatory molecules such as leptin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, that can promote an immune response leading to the cycle of cell death that kills beta cells. Exercise also helps to normalise plasma glucose and blood fats in both diabetic and pre-diabetic individuals, factors that when chronically elevated are known to cause beta cell death.</p><p>They also discuss the evidence from non-human studies in rats, showing that exercise can increase beta cell mass and also increase the amount of insulin produced per beta cell when the total number of cells is decreasing. Regarding evidence from humans, the authors discuss a number of differing studies, including the STRRIDE study from Sweden showing that moderate exercise in middle-aged, overweight people improved beta cell function. They also cite the improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood glucose control seen in many patients with type 2 diabetes who exercise.</p><p>In addition, there is evidence from other autoimmune diseases, such as Graves Thyroid disease, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis, that exercise can have a beneficial effect on the cells that are under autoimmune attack.</p><p>The authors say: \"There is little disagreement that physical exercise has health benefits in type 1 diabetes, and that it should be encouraged as part of routine management. Exercise promotes fitness, reduces insulin requirements and blood fats, improves blood vessel function and well-being, and reduces insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, exercise is associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia and increased fluctuations in glucose levels that may explain why it does not always improve blood sugar control in patients.\"</p><p>They continue: \"Studies have clearly shown that many people with type 1 diabetes do not undertake enough exercise, and that exercise is not actively promoted nor supported at the time of diagnosis with type 1 diabetes*. The reasons for this are multifactorial, complex, and include anxieties relating to hypoglycaemia and patients\\' loss of control over their diabetes. However if trials of exercise are shown to salvage residual beta cell function, there would be a strong argument to promote exercise much earlier in the natural history of this condition, and to develop strategies to encourage and support patients at this time. As a therapy, its attraction lies not only in the many health benefits exercise provides, but also because it can be carried out alone, or as a combination therapy for beta cell preservation in type 1 diabetes.\"</p><p>They conclude: \"We are currently undertaking a preliminary pilot study of exercise in patients with type 1 diabetes. With this information we hope we and others will be able to move forward to design and conduct large scale trials of exercise to preserve beta cell function in new onset type 1 diabetes. This will need to be tied into other mechanistic studies, as well as studies of exercise motivation and adherence.\"</p> \\nRates of type 1 diabetes - the autoimmune form of the condition that often begins in childhood and eventually results in lifelong dependency on insulin - are increasing in almost all nations...\\n',\n",
       " 'Metabolic genetics research paves way to treating diabetes and obesity\\n <p>Breaking down complex conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes and obesity into the specific metabolic proteins and processes that underlie them offers a new approach to studying the genetics of these diseases and how they are interrelated, according to research presented today at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2014 Annual Meeting in San Diego.</p><p>By studying specific proteins that contribute to such conditions - and the genes that encode them - scientists can develop new drugs that directly target the metabolic processes that do not function properly, explained lead author Jennifer E. Below, PhD, of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) School of Public Health. </p><p>\"In fact, genes that affect the same process at the protein level can end up influencing multiple traits in tandem,\" said Dr. Below. Working with colleagues at the Baylor College of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Chicago, Dr. Below found that genes that regulate a person\\'s circadian cycle affect quality of sleep but could also put him or her at risk for diabetes. Similarly, the researchers learned, a group of related proteins involved in immune system functions and interactions between cells also plays a role in heart health. </p><p>\"Findings such as this highlight the importance of capturing the array of effects of genes, rather than treating each analysis as independent. Traits don\\'t exist in silos; they are richly connected and interacting, and we benefit by acknowledging this in our genetic analyses,\" Dr. Below said. </p><p>The researchers have focused their efforts in Starr County, Texas, a community where trends in obesity and Type 2 Diabetes rates have steadily remained about 30 years ahead of the rest of the country. They have sequenced the genomes of more than 1,400 people in Starr County, studying relationships among many traits that affect obesity and diabetes, such as weight, sleep patterns, heart health, eye health, immune function, fat levels, and blood pressure. This allows them to tease apart the roles of lifestyle and environmental factors, including how these traits may affect one another. </p><p>\"Rates of obesity and diabetes have been increasing at an alarming pace in recent decades,\" Dr. Below said. \"While we know that the genes present in Starr County haven\\'t changed over that period, genetics still presents the best opportunity to study what\\'s happening. By breaking these conditions down into detailed traits and genetic sequence data, we could inform potential treatments,\" she explained. </p><p>In the future, Dr. Below and colleagues plan to study families in order to analyze rare genetic variants that may be present in larger numbers than in the general population, some of which may have a major effect on disease. </p><p>\"The community has been extremely supportive of our research, which will give us the ability to follow up with families to study the health effects of these rare, large-effect genetic mutations across time and generations,\" she said. </p><p>Other planned work includes analyzing the effects of rare genetic variants on metabolic processes beyond those known to affect obesity and diabetes, within families as well as in the broader population of Starr County. For example, the researchers have taken a detailed look at the proteins and processes involved in eye diseases such as retinal cardiomyopathy, which they plan to expand upon with a focus on family analyses and patterns of inheritance. </p> \\nBreaking down complex conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes and obesity into the specific metabolic proteins and processes that underlie them offers a new approach to studying the genetics of these...\\n',\n",

The study is by Dr Tsai Chung-Li, China Medical University, Taiwan, and colleagues.</p><p>\"Type 1 diabetes is considered to be caused by complex interaction between genetic susceptibility, the immune system, and environmental factors,\" say the authors. \"Though the cue for genetic predisposition has been elucidated, evidence also points to involvement of enterovirus (EV) infection, including viruses such as poliovirus, Coxsackievirus A, Coxsackievirus B, and echovirus.\"</p><p>To investigate the link between EV infection and subsequent type 1 diabetes, the researchers used nationwide population-based data from Taiwan\\'s national health insurance system. They looked at type 1 diabetes incidence in children aged up to 18 years with or without diagnosis of EV infection during 2000-2008.</p><p>Overall incidence of type 1 diabetes was higher in the EV-infected children than in the non-EV infected group (5.73 vs. 3.89 per 100,000 people per year, showing a 48% increased incidence rate in EV-infected versus non-EV-infected children). Hazard ratios of type 1 diabetes increased with age at diagnosis of EV infection, with a more than doubling of the risk of type 1 diabetes (2.18 times increased risk) for children aged over 10 years at entry. No relationship of allergic rhinitis or bronchial asthma to type 1 diabetes was found.</p><p>The authors point out that despite countries such as Finland and Sweden having the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes worldwide, they are thought to have low background rates of enterovirus infection, suggesting that genetic factors are a large component of the high type 1 diabetes rates in those countries. But they add: \"Regions such as Africa, Asia, South America have a low but increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes and high prevalence of enterovirus infection; environmental factors like enterovirus infection may play a vital role in increasing incidence in these regions.\"</p><p>They add: \"Taiwan has relatively low type 1 diabetes incidence; we believe that the marked escalation of the said incidence in recent decades can be largely attributed to the highly endemic spread of enterovirus infection in Taiwanese children, given that there has been little gene flow and genetic drift in such a short period.\"</p><p>They conclude: \"This nationwide retrospective cohort study found a positive correlation of type 1 diabetes with EV infection.

       " 'The specific receptor targeted by naltrexone to enhance diabetic wound closure is OGFr\\n <p>A major complication associated with diabetes is delayed cell replication in epithelium and skin. Researchers at The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania have reported the presence and function of the opioid growth factor (OGF) and its nuclear-associated receptor (OGFr) in skin. OGF, an inhibitory growth factor, chemically termed [Met5]-enkephalin, can be upregulated in diabetes leading to depressed cell proliferation. Topical naltrexone, a general opioid antagonist, stimulates cell replication but the specific ligand - opioid receptor pathway was previously unknown. Using rat auricular fibroblasts, and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, selective antagonists and specific ligands for mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were shown to have no acceleratory effect on cell proliferation. Molecular knockdown of receptors using siRNAs demonstrated that only when the OGFr receptor expression was diminished did naltrexone become ineffective. In vivo studies using a diabetic rat model of full thickness cutaneous wounds revealed that topical application of selective antagonists (i.e., nalmefene, naltrindole, CTOP) for classical opioid receptors had no effect on wound closure. These findings, reported in the October 2014 issue of Experimental Biology and Medicine, demonstrate that the specific opioid ligand - receptor pathway mediated by naltrexone in the process of enhanced cell replication is the OGF-OGFr regulatory pathway.</p><p>Professor Patricia McLaughlin, senior author of this study, said \"These findings show conclusively that the inhibitory factor OGF, and its receptor OGFr, play an integral role in maintaining the homeostasis of cell replication, and that blockade of their interfacing directly influence diabetic wound healing\".

       " 'Scientists discover a \\'good\\' fat that fights diabetes\\n <p>Scientists at the Salk Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston have discovered a new class of molecules - produced in human and mouse fat - that protects against diabetes.</p><p>The researchers found that giving this new fat, or lipid, to mice with the equivalent of type 2 diabetes lowered their elevated blood sugar, as detailed October 9 in Cell. The team also found that levels of the new lipids are low in humans with a high risk for diabetes, suggesting that the lipids could potentially be utilized as a therapy for metabolic disorders.</p><p>Lipids, like cholesterol, are typically associated with poor health. But in recent years, researchers have discovered that not all lipids are bad for you, such as the much touted omega-3 fatty acids that are found in fish oils. The newly discovered lipids, called fatty acid hydroxy fatty acids, or FAHFAs, were lower in humans with early stages of diabetes and were much higher in mice resistant to diabetes.</p><p>\"Based on their biology, we can add FAHFAs to the small list of beneficial lipids,\" says Alan Saghatelian, Salk professor in the Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology and one of the senior authors of the work. \"These lipids are amazing because they can also reduce inflammation, suggesting that we might discover therapeutic opportunities for these molecules in inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn\\'s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as diabetes.\"</p><p>FAHFAs had not been noticed previously in cells and tissues because they are present in low concentrations, making them difficult to detect. Using the latest mass spectrometry techniques, Saghatelian and Barbara Kahn, vice chair of the Department of Medicine at BIDMC and the other senior author of the work, uncovered the FAHFAs when they examined the fat of a diabetes-resistant mouse model developed by Kahn.</p><p>\"We engineered these mice to have more of a sugar transporter, called Glut4, in their fat because we had shown that when levels of this transporter are low, people are prone to developing diabetes,\" says Kahn. By examining how this sugar transporter might help protect against diabetes, the team noticed more fatty acid synthesis in mice that had improved insulin activity (and thereby were less likely to develop diabetes). The team collaborated to find out what lipids were involved.\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\"While many of the other lipids were essentially the same between normal mice and these diabetes-resistant mice, we saw these FAHFA lipids elevated by sixteen fold in mice that were resistant to diabetes, standing out really clearly as a big change,\" says Saghatelian. \"After that, we elucidated their structures using a combination of mass spectrometry and chemical synthesis. We basically uncovered a whole new class of molecules using these techniques.\"</p><p>Once they identified FAHFAs as being the lipid that was different between normal mice and these diabetes-resistant mice, they found something else important: when the mice eat FAHFAs, blood sugar levels dropped and insulin levels rose, indicating the potential therapeutic value of FAHFAs.</p><p>To determine whether FAHFAs are also relevant in humans, the team measured FAHFA levels in humans who are insulin-resistant (a condition which is often a precursor to diabetes) and found that their FAHFA levels were lower in fat and blood, suggesting that changes in FAHFA levels may contribute to diabetes.</p><p>\"The higher levels of these lipids seem to be associated with positive outcomes in mice and humans,\" says Kahn, who is also a professor at Harvard Medical School. \"We show that the lipids work through multiple mechanisms. When blood sugar is rising, such as after a meal, the lipids rapidly stimulate secretion of a hormone that signals the pancreas to secrete insulin. In addition, these novel lipids also directly stimulate sugar uptake into cells and reduce inflammatory responses in fat tissue and throughout the body.\"</p><p>These combined effects make the therapeutic potential of the lipids tremendous, say the researchers. Aside from existing in low levels within a wide range of vegetables, fruits and other foods, FAHFAs are also-unlike the other known beneficial lipids-produced and broken down inside the body. Potentially, new drugs could target the pathways that make or break down lipids to control FAHFA levels.</p><p>In the new paper, the team also identified the cellular receptor that FAHFAs bind to, called GPR120, to control how much glucose is absorbed into fat cells. The team thinks that increasing the body\\'s levels of FAHFAs may also be a way to activate GPR120 to treat or prevent diabetes.</p><p>\"This work may suggest that changes in FAHFA levels are a new mechanism in diabetes that was underappreciated before because these lipids weren\\'t known,\" says Saghatelian. \"We hope this work points to novel therapeutics that could boost the body\\'s own way of managing blood sugar.\"</p><p>\"Because we can detect low FAHFA levels in blood before a person develops diabetes, these lipids could serve as an early marker for diabetes risk,\" adds Kahn. \"We want to test whether restoring the lipids before diabetes develops might potentially reduce the risk or even prevent the disease.\"</p><div class=\"photobox_left\" style=\\'max-width:580px;\\' ><img src=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/images/articles/283/283755/glut4-and-fahfas.jpg\" alt=\"Glut4 and FAHFAs\"><br><em>The protein Glut4 moves to the cell surface to help transport glucose from the blood into the cell after a meal.

One twin had type 2 diabetes and the other was healthy.</p><p>\"Twins are a good model for finding mechanisms, but the results are applicable to all\", said Emma Nilsson, who carried out the study with Charlotte Ling.</p><p>We know that fat tissue can release hormones and regulate metabolism in different organs in the body.

This was a new finding.</p><p>Put in simple terms, small parts of the genetic code can be duplicated or be absent. Having too many or too few copies of a certain DNA sequence leads to changes in the properties of the specific gene.</p><p>\"We found six cases where one of the set of twins had more or fewer of these copies in his or her DNA, and we suspect that this could be another cause of the disease\", said Emma Nilsson, continuing:</p><p>\"This is interesting because it is usually taken for granted that identical twins are genetically 100 per cent alike. However, there are in fact differences and it is not known whether, or how, these affect the development of type 2 diabetes. More studies are needed to investigate their impact.\"</p><p>Epigenetics and DNA methylation</p><p>Epigenetic changes occur as a result of environmental and lifestyle factors, and affect the function of genes. The cells of the body contain our genetic make-up (DNA), which contains genes. Our genes are inherited and cannot be altered. On the genes are \\'methyl groups\\', which affect the expression of the gene, i.e. whether it is \\'on\\' or \\'off\\'. The methyl groups can be influenced in different ways through exercise, diet and lifestyle, in a process known as DNA methylation.</p><p>DNA methylation is a chemical process that controls the function of the genes. The chemical process can be affected by various environmental factors such as diet, exercise, stress, etc. which make the genes behave in different ways and be expressed to a greater or lesser degree.</p> \\nBy studying identical twins, researchers from Lund University in Sweden have identified mechanisms that could be behind the development of type 2 diabetes.\\n',\n",

Now, a new study suggests it may be possible to tackle the widespread disease by getting rid of the excess fat inside liver and muscle cells that interferes with their ability to use insulin.</header><div class=\"photobox_right\" style=\\'max-width:350px;\\' ><img src=\"/images/articles/283/283501/definition-of-diabetes-with-diabetes-highlighted.jpg\" alt=\"definition of diabetes with diabetes highlighted\"><br><em>The CDC report that an estimated 29 million Americans have diabetes, with over 27% of cases believed to be undiagnosed.</em></div> <p>The study team, led by Victor Shengkan Jin, an associate professor of pharmacology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, NJ, reports its findings in the journal <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p><p>According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 9% of Americans have diabetes. The vast majority of cases are type 2 diabetes, where the body develops insulin resistance - usually in adulthood. Type 1 diabetes is where the pancreas cannot produce insulin.</p><p>Of the estimated 29 million Americans with diabetes, about 8 million - over 27% - are undiagnosed.</p><p>Prof. Jin says a major reason the body stops being able to use insulin in type 2 diabetes - known as insulin resistance - is because excess fat accumulates in the cells of the liver and muscles.</p><p>This abnormal excess fat disrupts the ability of liver and muscle cells to absorb glucose or blood sugar and burn it for energy, causing levels in the bloodstream to become dangerously high and cause damage to tissues and organs. Untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney damage, heart diseases and other severe conditions.</p><h2>Burning excess fat with \\'mitochondrial uncoupling\\'</h2><p>Prof. Jin says they set out to find a safe and practical way of reducing levels of abnormal fat in the liver: \"We used mice to perform proof-of-principle experiments in our laboratory. We succeeded in removing fat, and that in turn improved the animals\\' ability to use insulin correctly and reduceblood sugar.\"</p><p>A key challenge in the study was finding a drug to do this. The team found one in a modification of an existing medication - niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NEN).</p><p>They found NEN burned the excess fat in liver cells by inducing a process called \"mitochondrial uncoupling.\"</p><p><strong>Mitochondria are the tiny batteries inside cells that provide them with the energy they need to carry out functions like dividing and making proteins. The energy in mitochondria comes from two fuels: fat and sugar. If there is too much fat, it interferes with the burning of sugar, so the idea is to bring down the level of excess fat and restore normal sugar burning.</strong></p><p>Prof. Jin likens the process to how a car works: the car is the cell and the engine is the mitochondria. The idea is to decouple the engine from the transmission and run it at full throttle to burn off the excess fat:</p><p>\"If too much of the fuel in the cell is fat, you keep burning it until the fuel gauge reaches empty,\" he explains. \"Without the interference of fat, you hope that sugar will then enter the cell normally.\"</p><p>The team hopes that doing this stops the interference of fat in liver and muscle cells, and restores their ability to respond properly to insulin and take up the right amount of sugar again. This could reverse the disease, they suggest.</p><h2>Excess fat \\'not just a problem for obese people\\'</h2><p>The drug they used - NEN - is a modified version of one that is already approved for human use. Prof. Jin says they deliberately chose it because they wanted a safe and practical compound to deplete fat inside cells. \"We went to the literature and found an approved drug that does in parasitic worms what we wanted to do in liver cells.\"</p><p>Although the modified form that they used is not currently used in humans, it has been used safely in other mammals so is likely to have a good safety profile in humans as well, he adds.</p><p>While their findings are far from certain, Prof. Jin says he is encouraged by the results they saw in the mice.</p><p><strong>He also notes that excess liver fat is not just a problem for obese people. Some people of normal weight can also have excess fat in their liver and develop type 2 diabetes. If shown to be safe and effective, the drug could treat patients of all weights, he adds.</strong></p><p>Prof. Jin is co-founder of Mito BioPharm, which has the exclusive right to use a Rutgers patent to develop NEN for commercial use.</p><p>The study follows a recent report in <em>JAMA</em> that shows diabetes rates in the US are no longer rising and suggests that slowing rates of obesity could be the reason.</p><p id=\\'slidebox_trigger\\'><strong>Written by</strong> Catharine Paddock PhD<br/></p> \\nStopping excess fat in the liver and muscles from interfering with cells\\' ability to respond to insulin and take up sugar could be a promising new way to tackle type 2 diabetes.\\n',\n",

Victor Jin and colleagues exploited this activity of the drug, using niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN), a salt form of niclosamide, to treat both a genetic and a dietary model of type 2 diabetes in mice. They found that NEN predominately accumulates in the liver and reduces the ability of the mitochondria in this organ to efficiently synthesis ATP. The lower cellular levels of ATP results in the activation of a signalling molecule, which signals the liver cells to increase the burning of stored fat.A hallmark of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, in which cells fail to respond to insulin resulting in increased levels of blood glucose.  Jin and colleagues report that the reduction of fat in the liver cells enabled them to respond to insulin and reduce levels of blood glucose. The increased intracellular fat burning in the liver of the treated mice also reduced the incidence of fatty liver, another common complication of type 2 diabetes. </p> \\nA derivative of the drug niclosamide, currently used to treat parasitic worm infections, is now found to relieve diabetic complications in mouse models of type 2 diabetes, reports a paper...\\n\",\n",

In animal studies, the team found that the capsule delivered insulin more efficiently than injection under the skin, and there were no harmful side effects as the capsule passed through the digestive system.</p><p>\"This could be a way that the patient can circumvent the need to have an infusion or subcutaneous administration of a drug,\" says Giovanni Traverso, a research fellow at MIT\\'s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, a gastroenterologist at MGH, and one of the lead authors of the paper, which appears in the <em>Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.</em></p><p>Although the researchers tested their capsule with insulin, they anticipate that it would be most useful for delivering biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies, which are used to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders like arthritis and Crohn\\'s disease. This class of drugs, known as \"biologics,\" also includes vaccines, recombinant DNA, and RNA.</p><p>\"The large size of these biologic drugs makes them nonabsorbable.

Their prototype acrylic capsule, 2 centimeters long and 1 centimeter in diameter, includes a reservoir for the drug and is coated with hollow, stainless steel needles about 5 millimeters long.</p><p>Previous studies of accidental ingestion of sharp objects in human patients have suggested that it could be safe to swallow a capsule coated with short needles. Because there are no pain receptors in the GI tract, patients would not feel any pain from the drug injection.</p><p>To test whether this type of capsule could allow safe and effective drug delivery, the researchers tested it in pigs, with insulin as the drug payload. It took more than a week for the capsules to move through the entire digestive tract, and the researchers found no traces of tissue damage, supporting the potential safety of this novel approach.</p><p>They also found that the microneedles successfully injected insulin into the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and colon, causing the animals\\' blood glucose levels to drop. This reduction in blood glucose was faster and larger than the drop seen when the same amount of glucose was given by subcutaneous injection.</p><p>\"The kinetics are much better, and much faster-onset, than those seen with traditional under-the-skin administration,\" Traverso says. \"For molecules that are particularly difficult to absorb, this would be a way of actually administering them at much higher efficiency.\"</p><p>\"This is a very interesting approach,\" says Samir Mitragotri, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California at Santa Barbara who was not involved in the research. \"Oral delivery of drugs is a major challenge, especially for protein drugs.

The research is by Dr Yann Klimentidis, an Assistant Professor at the University of Arizona Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, in Tucson, AZ, USA, and colleagues.</p><p>It is well established that physical activity reduces type 2 diabetes risk. However, the extent of protection afforded by physical activity may differ according to genetic factors.

The researchers studied interactions of physical activity with 1) each of 65 type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs, 2) a genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of all 65 SNPs, 3) two GRSs comprised of SNPs implicated in insulin resistance and insulin secretion, and 4) GRSs for fasting insulin and glucose.</p><p>Each individual\\'s level of physical activity was assessed through the Baecke Physical Activity questionnaire, a standard assessment tool.

Based on the interactions observed with the insulin resistance GRS and the fasting insulin GRS, it appears that the overall type 2 diabetes GRS interaction most likely occurs through genetic susceptibility to insulin resistance, as opposed to insulin secretion. Furthermore, this interaction was more pronounced in women than in men.

NM505 is a combination of metformin and active ingredients contained in the company\\'s lead microbiome modulator, NM504.</p><p> Metformin, an effective, safe and inexpensive medication, is recommended for initial treatment of Type 2 diabetes by the American Diabetes Association and others. However, diarrhea is a well-known side effect of metformin therapy, affecting an estimated 20% of patients.  Physicians report diarrhea as a frequent cause of metformin discontinuation and dosage limitation.</p><p> In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, a preliminary formulation of NM505 was administered orally to patients with Type 2 diabetes who were metformin intolerant due to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.  Results of the study showed that metformin tolerability was significantly greater with NM505 than with metformin and placebo, as measured by full days on the drug and ability to escalate the dose via more frequent dosing. Higher and more frequent doses of metformin are associated with better blood glucose control. Subjects receiving NM505 showed improvements in fasting blood glucose levels and also reported less severe GI side effects than those receiving metformin and placebo.</p><p> Steve Orndorff, PhD, CEO of MicroBiome Therapeutics, noted, \"Based on these encouraging results as well as previous data showing that NM504 can improve blood glucose control in diabetes, we are preparing an IND filing for a larger clinical trial that, if successful, would enable us to seek U.S. FDA marketing approval for NM505 via the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Increasing the utility of metformin could decrease reliance on oral second-line anti-diabetes therapies, which are expensive and carry risks of potentially serious side effects.\"</p><p> In an earlier clinical study in prediabetic and Type 2 diabetes patients, microbiome modulator NM504 shifted the gut microflora in beneficial ways, significantly improving post prandial blood glucose and insulin levels. This suggests that the modulators in NM504 may offer an additional glucose-lowering mechanism, which when combined with metformin could potentially deliver superior glycemic control as well as reduced side effects compared to currently-approved metformin formulations.</p><p> The concept for NM505 stems from 2012, when a newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetic who was unable to tolerate metformin received NM504 as adjunctive therapy.

A study recently reported by <em>Medical News Today</em>, for example, found a higher risk of coronary heart disease among people who work more than 60 hours a week.</p><p>The researchers of this latest study, led by Mika KivimÃ\\x83Â¤ki, professor of epidemiology at University College London in the UK, notes that past studies have also linked long working hours to stress, unhealthy lifestyles, depressive symptoms and disturbed sleep, which they say are factors that can contribute to development of diabetes.</p><p>\"However, the direct association between long working hours and incident type 2 diabetes has been assessed in only a few studies,\" the researchers add.</p><p>With this in mind, the team conducted the largest study so far to investigate how long working hours influence the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><h2>Long hours in low socioeconomic status jobs \\'increases type 2 diabetes risk by 30%\\'</h2><p>To reach their findings, the team analyzed data from a selection of published and unpublished studies looking at the effect of long working hours on type 2 diabetes.

Those who work long hours in low socioeconomic status jobs may be more likely to have less sleep and less time to engage in physical exercise, for example, which may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>\"It is also possible that working long hours in low socioeconomic groups is a marker of other risk factors, such as low pay and financial constraints,\" said Prof. KivimÃ\\x83Â¤ki. \"Those with a high  socioeconomic status are less likely to have such hardships.\"</p><p>Commenting on their overall findings, Prof. KivimÃ\\x83Â¤ki says:</p><blockquote><p>\"The pooling of all available studies on this topic allowed us to investigate the association between working hours and diabetes risk with greater precision than has been previously possible. </p><p>Although working long hours is unlikely to increase diabetes risk in everyone, health professionals should be aware that it is associated with a significantly increased risk in people doing low socioeconomic status jobs.\"</p></blockquote><p>When <em>MNT</em> asked Prof. KivimÃ\\x83Â¤ki if people in low socioeconomic status jobs should reduce their working hours to reduce diabetes risk, he replied that no studies have suggested that lowering working hours would have such an effect.</p><p><strong>\"For this reason, my recommendation for people who wish to decrease their risk of type 2 diabetes is to eat and drink healthfully, be physically active, avoid overweight, do not smoke, and keep blood glucose and lipids levels within the normal range.

Published in <em>The Lancet</em>, the work received support from a number of funders including the Medical Research Council, British Heart Foundation, Rosetrees Trust and National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre.</p><p>Among nearly 130 000 participants from clinical trials that previously tested the effect of statins on heart disease and stroke (major vascular events), those assigned statins vs. placebo, or higher vs. lower doses of statins, were noted to have a small increase in risk of developing type 2 diabetes of about 12% over a four-year period, and also to gain an excess of 240g (around half a pound) in weight.</p><p>\"Weight gain is a risk factor for diabetes which might help explain the small increased risk of diabetes observed in people taking statins\", explains co-lead author Dr David Preiss of the University of Glasgow Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences. </p><p>Statins work by reducing the efficiency of a liver enzyme involved in cholesterol production, which causes liver cells to trap more low-density lipoprotein (LDL-) cholesterol from the bloodstream, reducing its circulating level.  This mechanism is thought to underlie the efficacy of statins in lowering the risk of major vascular events.</p><p>\"Commonly occurring variants in the gene encoding the same liver enzyme are associated with a lower LDL-cholesterol,\" explains co-lead author Dr Daniel Swerdlow of the UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science. \"Incorporating information from up to 220 000 individuals, we found that these genetic variants were also associated with a higher weight and marginally higher type 2 diabetes risk. The effects were very much smaller than from statin treatment, but the genetic findings indicate that the weight gain and diabetes risk observed in the analysis from trials are related to the known mechanism of action of statins rather than some other unintended effect.\"\"The genetic findings of our study help to explain the mechanism by which statins increase weight and diabetes risk,\" says co-senior author Professor Aroon Hingorani, director of the UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science. \"However, the effects of the genetic variants are orders of magnitude lower than the effects of statins. There is also no indication from this study that an individual\\'s genetic make-up will meaningfully affect their clinical response to statin treatment. Statin drugs should continue to be prescribed without the need for any form of genetic testing.\"</p><p>Taking the known risk of new onset diabetes into account, current guidelines from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggest that statin treatment should be offered to people with a 10% or higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years. Statins are also recommended for people who have had a heart attack or stroke to reduce the risk of future incidents. Statins are effective in reducing cardiovascular events in people with established diabetes.</p><p>\"Previous analyses have indicated that the cardiovascular benefits of statin treatment greatly outweigh the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes,\" says co-senior author Professor Naveed Sattar of the University of Glasgow Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences. \"Nevertheless, many patients eligible for statin treatment would also benefit from lifestyle changes including increased physical activity, eating more healthily and stopping smoking. The modest increases in weight and diabetes risk seen in this study could easily be mitigated by adopting healthier diets and lifestyles. Reinforcing the importance of lifestyle changes when discussing these issues with patients would further enhance the benefit of statin treatment in preventing heart attacks and strokes.\"</p> \\nThe mechanism by which statins increase the risk of type 2 diabetes has been investigated in a large-scale analysis from an international team led by researchers from UCL and the University of...\\n',\n",

       " 'Mapping complex trait genes in multiparental populations\\n <p>Life is rarely simple. From crop yields to disease risks, the biological characteristics people care most about are usually those considered \"complex traits.\" Just as for height - the textbook example of a complex trait - attributes like risk for a particular human disease are shaped by multiple genetic and environmental influences, making it challenging to find the genes involved. To track down such genes, geneticists typically mate two individuals that differ in key ways - for example, a large mouse and a small mouse - and then study their descendents, looking for genes that tend to be inherited with the trait value of interest. But this method only implicates a broad genomic region, and the identities of the crucial gene/s often remain a mystery.</p><p>Now, geneticists are embracing a powerful approach that pinpoints more precise areas of the genome by founding the breeding population with multiple, genetically diverse parents. To encourage innovations in this rapidly developing field, the Genetics Society of America journals <em>GENETICS</em> and <em>G3: Genes Genomes Genetics</em> have published the first articles in an ongoing special collection on mapping complex trait genes in multiparental populations.</p><p>The 18 articles describe methods and applications in a wide range of organisms, including mice, fruit flies, and maize. Among the advances reported are the creation of a multiparental population of wheat, methods for use with the Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mouse populations, and the identification of nicotine resistance genes in fruit flies. The power of the approach for disease genetics is highlighted in an article describing how a multiparental rat population was used to find a human gene variant that affects insulin levels.</p><p>\"These collections of multiparental strains are extremely powerful and greatly accelerate discovery. For example, in one of the articles, researchers report using a multiparental population to rapidly identify fruit fly genome regions associated with the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs. The authors could then examine these regions to find several candidate causative genes,\" said Dirk-Jan de Koning, Professor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Deputy Editor-in-Chief, Complex Traits, at <em>G3</em>, and an editor of the new collection. \"Using standard two-parent crosses, they would have been stuck with unmanageably large regions each containing hundreds or even thousands of candidate genes.\"</p><p>Because the field is so new, geneticists are still developing the best methods for creating and analyzing multiparental populations. \"This collection will move the field forward by stimulating discussion between different disciplines and research communities,\" said Lauren McIntyre, Professor at the University of Florida, and an editor of the collection. \"To help foster this ongoing exchange, the collection will continue to publish new articles, and all associated data will be freely available.\"</p><p>In an editorial, McIntyre and de Koning describe how the idea for the multiparental populations collection was born and how scientific society journals like <em>GENETICS</em> and<em> G3</em> can advance new research fields.</p> \\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Traditional Asian diet lowered  insulin resistance in Asian Americans\\n <p>Why are Asian Americans at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than Caucasian Americans, and prone to develop the disease at lower body weights? One part of this puzzle may lie in the transition from traditional high-fiber, low-fat Asian diets to current westernized diets, which may pose extra risks for those of Asian heritage, says George King, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at Joslin Diabetes Center and the senior author of the study. </p><p>A Joslin randomized clinical trial now has demonstrated that both Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans at risk of type 2 diabetes who adopted a rigorously controlled traditional Asian diet lowered their insulin resistance. (A leading risk factor for developing the disease, insulin resistance is a condition in which the body struggles to use the hormone insulin, which helps to metabolize sugar.)</p><p>Moreover, when both groups of participants then switched to consuming typical western fare, the Asian Americans experienced greater increases in insulin resistance than did the Caucasian Americans, says Dr. King, senior author on a paper on the study published in the journal <em>PLOS One</em>.</p><p>The 16-week pilot trial was completed by 24 East Asian Americans and 16 Caucasian Americans, who had an average age of 34 and were either of normal weight or overweight but not obese. All the volunteers had a family history of type 2 diabetes or another indication of diabetes risk such as gestational diabetes.</p><p>For the first eight weeks, all the participants ate a traditional high-fiber East Asian diet with 70% of calories from carbohydrates, 15% from protein and 15% from fat, and providing 15 g fiber/1,000 kcal. The food was prepared fresh by local chefs and delivered every two days. \"Three meals and one snack were included each day, and we made sure that they were nutritious as well as very tasty,\" says Ka Hei Karen Lau, a Joslin dietitian and certified diabetes educator.</p><p>For the second eight weeks, 33 of the volunteers (20 Asian Americans and 13 Caucasian Americans) transitioned to a typical low-fiber western diet with 50% of calories from carbohydrates, 16% from protein and 34% from fat, and providing 6 g fiber/1,000 kcal. Seven volunteers (4 Asian Americans and 3 Caucasian Americans) stayed on the traditional Asian diet to act as controls for the study.</p><p>Meeting with the trial participants every two weeks, the Joslin team adjusted individual diets as needed to keep their weights relatively steady, so that changes in their metabolism were not driven primarily by changes in weight.</p><p>Maintaining those steady body weights for trial participants was a challenge, King remarks. \"It was almost impossible to prevent people from losing weight on the Asian diet, and that was not because the food wasn\\'t good!\" he says. \"And almost everybody gained weight on the western diet, and we had to work very hard so they didn\\'t gain too much.\"</p><p>The researchers suggested that the combination of high fiber and low fat in the traditional diet may help to explain the decrease in insulin resistance, especially for the Asian American participants.</p><p>Additionally, those on the traditional Asian diet lowered their LDL cholesterol, a potential benefit for cardiovascular health.</p><p>\"These results were very exciting for Asian Americans,\" Lau says. \"We are at high risk for diabetes, but we can use diet to help prevent it.\"</p><p>Joslin\\'s Asian Clinic now promotes a traditional Asian diet and shares suitable recipes with patients.</p><p>The researchers hope to follow up the pilot trial with a larger trial that compares results of a traditional Asian diet with a westernized Asian diet and does not try to control participant weight.</p><p>Asian Americans have about 20% higher risks of developing type 2 diabetes than Caucasian Americans.

ADI is publishing this report, in conjunction with World Alzheimer\\'s Day&trade; (21 September) and as a part of World Alzheimer\\'s Month, an international campaign to raise awareness and challenge stigma.</p><p>The report reveals that control of diabetes and high blood pressure as well as measures to encourage smoking cessation and to reduce cardiovascular risk, have the potential to reduce the risk of dementia even in late-life. The report found that diabetes can increase the risk of dementia by 50%. Obesity and lack of physical activity are important risk factors for diabetes and hypertension, and should, therefore, also be targeted.</p><p>While cardiovascular health is improving in many high income countries, many low and middle income countries show a recent pattern of increasing exposure to cardiovascular risk factors, with rising rates of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.</p><p>Smoking cessation is strongly linked in the report with a reduction in dementia risk. For example, studies of dementia incidence among people aged 65 years and over show that ex-smokers have a similar risk to those who have never smoked, while those who continue to smoke are at much higher risk.</p><p>Furthermore, the study revealed that those who have had better educational opportunities have a lower risk of dementia in late-life. Evidence suggests that education has no impact on the brain changes that lead to dementia, but reduces their impact on intellectual functioning.</p><p>The evidence in the report suggest that if we enter old age with better developed, healthier brains we are likely to live longer, happier and more independent lives, with a much reduced chance of developing dementia. Brain health promotion is important across the life span, but particularly in mid-life, as changes in the brain can begin decades before symptoms appear.</p><p>The study also urges NCD programs to be more inclusive of older people, with the message that it\\'s never too late to make a change, as the future course of the global dementia epidemic is likely to depend crucially upon the success or failure of efforts to improve global public health, across the population. Combining efforts to tackle the increasing global burden of NCDs will be strategically important, efficient and cost effective. Leading a healthier lifestyle is a positive step towards preventing a range of long-term diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes.</p><p>However, survey data released by Bupa has shown that many people are unclear about the causes and actions they can take to potentially reduce their risk of dementia. Just over a sixth (17%) of people realised that social interaction with friends and family could impact on the risk. Only a quarter (25%) identified being overweight as a possible factor, and only one in five (23%) said physical activity could affect the risk of developing dementia and losing their memories. The survey also revealed that over two thirds (68%) of people surveyed around the world are concerned about getting dementia in later life.</p><p>Professor Martin Prince, from King\\'s College London\\'s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and author of the report, commented: \"There is already evidence from several studies that the incidence of dementia may be falling in high income countries, linked to improvements in education and cardiovascular health. We need to do all we can to accentuate these trends. With a global cost of over US$ 600 billion, the stakes could hardly be higher.\"</p><p>Marc Wortmann, Executive Director, Alzheimer\\'s Disease International said: \"From a public health perspective, it is important to note that most of the risk factors for dementia overlap with those for the other major non communicable diseases (NCDs). In high income countries, there is an increased focus on healthier lifestyles, but this is not always the case with lower and middle income countries. By 2050, we estimate that 71% of people living with dementia will live in these regions, so implementing effective public health campaigns may help to reduce the global risk.\"</p><p>Professor Graham Stokes, Global Director of Dementia Care, Bupa, said: \"While age and genetics are part of the disease\\'s risk factors, not smoking, eating more healthily, getting some exercise, and having a good education, coupled with challenging your brain to ensure it is kept active, can all play a part in minimising your chances of developing dementia. People who already have dementia, or signs of it, can also do these things, which may help to slow the progression of the disease.\"</p> \\nThe World Alzheimer Report 2014 \\'Dementia and Risk Reduction: An analysis of protective and modifiable factors\\', calls for dementia to be integrated into both global and national public health...\\n',\n",

Since walking on stairs is one of the most dangerous daily activities in terms of fall risk, this study investigated the underlying mechanisms of unsteadiness in patients with DPN during stair ascent and descent.</p><p>Motion and force data were collected for 22 diabetes patients with DPN with a mean age of 57 years, and 40 diabetes patients without DPN (also mean age 57 years), plus 32 healthy non-diabetic controls (mean age 50 years). All patients were from Manchester or the surrounding area. Movement data was collected using a 10-camera 3D motion analysis system from reflective markers placed at anatomical locations on the body to calculate whole-body centre-of-mass (CoM). The centre-of-pressure (CoP) under the feet was measured using 4 force platforms mounted into the middle 4 steps of a 7-step staircase, which participants ascended and descended at least 3 times. Balance was quantified by assessing the separation between the centre-of-mass and centre-of-pressure (CoM-CoP separation) in the medial-lateral plane (i.e. side-to-side).</p><p>The researchers found that during stair ascent the DPN group showed significantly higher maximum CoM-CoP separation of 13cm, compared to 10cm for both the diabetes patients without DPN and the control group; and also significantly increased variation in CoM-CoP separation: 7cm for the DPN group, 5cm for the diabetes only group, and 6cm for the control group.</p><p>During stair descent differences were also evident: the DPN group again showed significantly higher maximum CoM-CoP separation, a mean of 15cm versus 13cm for diabetes patients without DPN and 12cm for controls. The DPN group also saw significantly increased variation in CoM-CoP separation of mean 8cm versus 7cm for both the diabetes patients without DPN and control group. The DPN group also displayed a significantly wider stance width compared to the other groups during stair descent only: mean for DPN 17cm versus 15cm for both diabetes patients without DPN and control groups.</p><p>No differences in any variable were observed in the diabetes patients without DPN compared to the control group during stair ascent or descent.</p><p>The authors conclude: \"Diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy display greater extremes in magnitude of medial-lateral sway during stair ascent and descent as well as displaying higher variability during stair ascent and descent. This indicates that patients with DPN have difficulty regulating control of balance during this challenging task. A larger and more variable medial- lateral sway means that patients with DPN are more likely to lose control of balance and experience a fall during what is known to be an activity - using stairs  - where the risk of falls is already very high.\"</p><p>The authors acknowledge that, while it would be impractical to suggest patients with DPN avoid stairs completely, they are at higher risk of a fall and should take measures to keep themselves safe. \"Avoiding particularly steep and/or long flights of stairs may be advisable, especially if an elevator is available as an alternative,\" say the authors. \"Using a handrail on stairs if available could also help patients with DPN prevent falls.\" They add that \"Since our research has identified details regarding how patients with DPN sway, and therefore how they are most at risk, this may allow future research to target balance interventions to improve the medial-lateral balance in this population.\"</p><p>The research team is doing further investigations various aspects of gait and how diabetes and DPN affects how these patients walk on level ground and on stairs, to identify and further understand factors that may contribute to unsteadiness and in turn the increased risk of falls. They add: \"Many issues that affect balance in patients with DPN stem from deterioration of muscle size and function, so whilst it is not currently possible to positively improve the sensory deterioration, we have been looking at elements that we can positively influence, such as strength training and interventions to help vision focus and avoidance of obstacles. We are investigating the impact of such interventions and how they might translate to improvements in gait and balance control.\" </p> \\nNew research presented at this year\\'s annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria, shows that people suffering from diabetic peripheral...\\n',\n",

The economic burden of hypoglycaemia, calculated using the Local Impact of Hypoglycaemia Tool (LIHT), was presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 50th Annual Meeting. The LIHT model estimates that hypoglycaemic episodes in adults that require NHS resources could cost up to Ã\\x82Â£2,195, and this could increase substantially with an extended stay in hospital<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Existing figures on the rates of hypoglycaemia among people with diabetes have already demonstrated it to be one of the most common short-term complications of this complex condition. Those with type 1 diabetes have been shown to experience approximately two non-severe episodes per week, and insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes experience approximately one non-severe episode every two weeks<sup>2</sup>. Severe hypoglycaemia can require emergency assistance - and research has shown that people with type 1 diabetes may experience on average 3.2 severe episodes per year, with those with type 2 diabetes experiencing approximately 0.7 severe episodes per year<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>LIHT estimates the economic impact of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes in national and local populations. On a local health economy level, assuming a hypothetical population of 100,000, LIHT estimates the total cost of managing hypoglycaemic episodes to be Ã\\x82Â£543,493 per year (Ã\\x82Â£352,163 for severe episodes, Ã\\x82Â£191,330 for non- severe episodes). With a hypothetical reduction in hypoglycaemia rates of 25% (totalling 364 severe episodes and 3,759 non-severe episodes) the LIHT shows a potential cost saving of Ã\\x82Â£135,873 per 100,000 people, equating to Ã\\x82Â£90.9 million for the UK as a whole<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Witesh Parekh, Health Economist at Novo Nordisk and Lead Developer of LIHT, commented: \"LIHT highlights the economic burden of hypoglycaemia against any given population, but more importantly it can demonstrate the savings that could be made by reducing incidence of hypoglycaemia. Novo Nordisk has developed the LIHT to help assist healthcare professionals and NHS budget holders with decision making for the overall management of hypoglycaemia. In particular, it offers an opportunity to offset costs of new insulin treatments and patient education programmes with costs of hypoglycaemic episodes, thus improving patient care.\"</p><p>The economic burden of hypoglycaemia is likely to be underestimated. Incidence of hypoglycaemia is significantly under-reported in insulin-treated patients with diabetes (type 1 and type 2), data from the largest ever global study on hypoglycaemia have shown<sup>4</sup>. The results of the Hypoglycaemia Assessment Tool (HAT) study reveal the importance of identifying the impact of hypoglycaemia and taking action to manage this common diabetes complication.</p><p>The HAT study, also presented today at the EASD 50th Annual Meeting, was designed to determine the extent of self-reported hypoglycaemia experienced in a global population of patients with insulin-treated diabetes, using self-assessment questionnaires and patient diaries. The findings showed an increase in incidence of overall hypoglycaemia in the four-week evaluation period after the study compared to the four-week evaluation prior to the study*<sup>4</sup>:</p><ul><li>47% increase in the number of events per patient year in type 1 diabetes</li><li>20% increase in the number of events per patient year in type 2 diabetes</li></ul><p>The increased incidence of overall hypoglycaemia in the reporting period after the study suggests significant under-reporting from patients for all types of hypoglycaemia. Rates of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia were also higher than previously demonstrated in other studies.</p><p>Professor Kamlesh Khunti, Professor of Primary Care Diabetes & Vascular Medicine, University of Leicester, noted: \"It is clear from the results of this study that people with diabetes often do not recognise and report episodes of hypoglycaemia. As healthcare professionals, we should be actively educating patients to ensure they fully understand what a hypoglycaemic event is, how to accurately record any incidences and, importantly, report them so that we are able to discuss management strategies - which may include tailoring treatment regimens according to individual patient need.\"</p> \\nNew figures released September 16, 2014 show the cost of managing hypoglycaemia in the UK could be Ã\\x82Â£363.6 million per year (Ã\\x82Â£235.\\n',\n",
       " 'The Euro Diabetes Index forms best practice check-list\\n <p>Diabetes care in Europe makes progress, as shown by a European comparison of diabetes prevention and treatment presented during the 50th Congress of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna. Since 2006, the combination of healthier lifestyle, better and broader patient education, better trained physicians and improved access to treatment and devices has reduced the number of deaths in Europe due to diabetes by 10 000 a year (plus an even larger reduction of deaths from diabetes-related heart disease).</p><p>But as more and more people are becoming diagnosed with diabetes, diabetes care must become much more efficient. National diabetes care should move towards a pan-European best practice, the main components outlined by the study. This is the main message from the Euro Diabetes Index 2014, published today by the Sweden-based research organisation Health Consumer Powerhouse (HCP).</p><p><strong>The Euro Diabetes Index outcomes in short</strong></p><p>The Index - a follow-up of the 2008 Euro Diabetes Index - covers the following areas, using 28 indictors: Prevention, Case finding, Range and reach of services, Access to treatment/care, Procedures and Outcomes.</p><p>The 30 countries (EU 28 plus Norway and Switzerland) are ranked according to how well they meet the indicator requirements. Sweden comes out top with 936 of a maximum 1000 points, followed by the Netherlands (922), Denmark (863), UK (812) and Switzerland (799).</p><p>The ranking of all 30 countries is in the graph below.</p><div class=\"photobox_right\" style=\\'max-width:350px;\\' ><img src=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/images/articles/282/282654/euro-diabetes-index-2014.png\" alt=\"Euro Diabetes Index 2014\"><br><em>Euro Diabetes Index 2014</em></div><p><strong> What are the key recommendations for improved European diabetes care?</strong></p>The 2014 Euro Diabetes Index points to pillars for a potential European best practice in diabetes prevention and care:</p><ul><li>Lack of regular exercise and inappropriate nutrition should be addressed, as they cause obesity - a major diabetes type 2 risk factor</li><li>National diabetes registries - exist today in no more than seven of 30 compared countries</li><li>Transparency must improve, making diabetes care data easier to access and compare</li><li>Systematic screening among high-risk groups must become reality to detect undiagnosed cases - today such screening hardly exists in many countries</li><li>Medication and other kinds of self-management devices must be sufficiently deployed and subsidised</li><li>Structured education for patients and relatives</li><li>Regular check-ups for eye, foot and renal complications.</li></ul><p>The diabetes physicians (including GPs and nurses) need to be trained to understand and adopt and new technologies, to expand their proper use.</p><p>- Despite the burden posed by the disease, most countries have no established best practice for treatment. Since 2008, when the very first Euro Diabetes Index was published, there has been very slow increase of the number of national diabetes registries. Still, most countries cannot present data on procedures and treatment outcomes, says Dr Beatriz Cebolla, EDI director.</p><p>- Diabetes care forerunners such as Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark have a strong fundament for screening, registration and follow up for diabetes cases, explains Dr. Bjornberg, head of HCP Index research. Fewer people fall between chairs and risk having complications. Procedures and outcomes are well documented, with reliable data. Nothing of this is rocket science but takes tedious ever-day efforts and co-operation to put in place. At the same time, it is hard to imagine how to address the diabetes growth without such best practice methodology!</p><p><strong>Main EDI conclusions</strong></p><p>The EDI recommendations above are based from the following conclusions and an analysis of the diabetes care situation around Europe as well as communication with patient groups, researchers and national health authorities.</p><p>In general, there is improvement in diabetes care compared to the inaugural Euro Diabetes Index in 2008, particularly regarding quality data acquisition and survival from diabetes complications. There are estimates saying that every year another 10 000 European diabetics survive (compared to 2006). A number of countries have started audits or annual data collection publications to increase awareness and improve outcomes. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to reach an optimal care provision and management of diabetes in Europe:</p><ul><li>Still, only seven among 30 countries report having national diabetes registries. The lack of reliable data in indicators regarding process and outcomes is unfortunately widespread.</li><li>The comparability of data collected is poor across the EU. The indicator definitions vary enormously from country to country, often making it impossible to compare data from different countries.</li><li>There are important differences between sedentary lifestyles in different European countries. Physical activity varies between countries and individuals. Eating habits are also very different between countries but in general a rather low intake or non-optimal intake of vegetable and fruits and a growing consumption of soft drinks and inexpensive fast foods high in fat, salt and calories. Lack of regular physical exercise and inappropriate nutrition is causing an increase of obesity all over Europe - one main risk factor for Diabetes type 2.</li><li>Early detection and appropriate intervention presents an opportunity to improve outcomes for people with type 2. It seems there is almost no systematic screening of high-risk groups anywhere in Europe. Screening is frequently not uniform or systematic, even within the same country or region, but very much dependent on individual doctors\\' knowledge and keenness.</li><li>There are a number of factors hindering optimal management of diabetes:</li><ul><li>The provision of drugs and devices for proper management of the disease is essential. Surprisingly, in the past few years a high number of countries have been reducing the provision of such essential materials. Higher private co-payments are frequently required from patients and families to receive correct disease management.</li><li>Good access to continuous efficient and structured patient education, including patients\\' families. However, it seems patients receive different degrees of quality of education, depending very much on the local professional teams.</li><li>Patients\\' adherence to treatment is very dependent on patients understanding the procedure and importance of correct treatment. This is also related with regular contact with physicians to take decisions together with the patient.</li><li>Proper training for Doctors, nurses and other health care workers dealing with diabetes.</li></ul><li>The lack of data made it hard to compare indicators regarding Procedures and Outcomes. But in general it seems there is the tendency to follow recommendations and guidelines. More and more patients are being followed on regular basis to monitor and prevent secondary complications than was the case in 2008.</li><li>Access to foot care improved in the past years. However, a broad majority of countries still do annual foot check-ups on less than 60% of diabetics.</li><li>Eye care for diabetics is far from being where it should be. The lack of data on this subject in all countries is remarkable. A low proportion of patients get regular examinations (every two years). The quality of those examinations is also differing.</li></ul><p><strong>Diabetes background and figures</strong></p><p>Diabetes is one of the most critical issues facing healthcare systems across the EU, with a high burden of disease and rising prevalence. The diabetes community has been advocating for many years to make diabetes a policy priority in all European countries with some successes. These include the 2012 EU resolution calling on the EU Commission and Member States to develop and implement a targeted EU Diabetes Strategy and, at the end of 2013, a work package dedicated entirely to diabetes in the EU\\'s Joint Action on Chronic Diseases. These achievements make important steps forward, but more work is needed to ensure that diabetes is recognised as a key public policy priority across Europe and allocated sufficient resources to reduce the heavy burden of the illness.</p><ul><li>In 2013, more than 32 million Europeans live with diabetes, i.e. 8.1% of the population.</li><li>By 2035, the population living with diabetes is expected to increase to 38 million.</li><li>Only 50% of the population with diabetes have been diagnosed.</li><li>Over 50% of adults with diabetes fail to reach the levels of blood sugar required.</li><li>In 2013, Europe spent approximately &euro;100-150bn on treating and caring for diabetes.</li><li>Diabetes is a major cause of kidney failure, blindness, foot and leg amputation and heart disease.</li><li>One in ten deaths in Europe can be attributed to diabetes - equaling 619 000 deaths in 2013.</li><li>Europe is home to the highest number of children with type 1 diabetes in the world.</li><li>Europe has the highest incidence rate for new cases of type 1 diabetes in children.</li><li>There is growing evidence that type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is increasing.</li><li>Young people with type 2 diabetes risk developing complications earlier in life, with devastating consequences for their families and society.</li><li>Currently, reliable data on the true costs of caring for people living with diabetes is scarce. The issue of having accurate and timely data on diabetes medicines and medical devices thus needs to addressed, as currently decisions are being made in the absence of such information.</li><li>A rise in diabetes and diabetes-related complications will put a severe strain on healthcare systems which currently spend on average an estimated 10% of their budget on diabetes care. In some countries, this figure is as high as 20%.</li><li>IDF Europe is an umbrella organization representing 69 diabetes organisations in 47 countries across Europe. It is the European chapter of the International Diabetes Federation</li></ul><p><strong>Who produced the Index and how was it developed?</strong></p><p>Health Consumer Powerhouse (HCP) has developed the comparative index ranking of 28 EU Member States (plus Norway and Switzerland) first published in 2008, according to country performance with regard to type 1 and 2-diabetes over the course of 2014.</p><p>HCP, the leading European provider of consumer information on health care, worked with experts from across Europe and the different fields of diabetes to develop a number of indicators for assessing diabetes care. 28 indicators from a long list of indicators were scored in a systematic manner to reflect and compare the healthcare situation in the different EU countries (plus Norway and Switzerland), from perspectives ranging from prevention policies to access to treatment, the management of the disease and patient outcomes.</p><p>The indicators were organised into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Prevention</li><li>Case finding</li><li>Range and reach of services (\"Generosity of care\")</li><li>Access to Treatment/Care</li><li>Procedures</li><li>Outcomes</li></ul><p>Once the indicators were defined, HCP gathered information from a variety of sources including existing data, country visits with experts and face-to-face interviews. To be used as a feed-back information, an e-questionnaire was designed to collect responses from patient organisations representatives and other relevant stakeholders. One benefit of collecting data in this fashion is that it opens and fosters a dialogue with key stakeholders.

OpT2mise is the largest global study to compare insulin pump therapy to multiple daily insulin injections in people with type 2 diabetes with poor glycemic control. Three new poster presentations at EASD show that people using insulin pump therapy were more satisfied with their treatment than those on multiple daily injections (MDI) and that better glucose control was achieved with pump therapy, regardless of age, duration of diabetes, results of cognitive testing and fingerstick measurement compliance.</p><p>\"In my experience patients were generally very surprised by the high quality of life they experience with the pump,\" said Prof. Yves Reznik from the University Hospital of Caen, France, and principal investigator of the OpT2mise trial. \"Several of the patients in the trial were reluctant to start on an insulin pump. However, after wearing it for a few days, they told me that if they had known it was so easy, they would have switched to pump therapy much earlier.\"</p><p>\"The most interesting - though not surprising - observation to me was that, at the end of the study, most patients opted to continue with the pump therapy,\" added Professor Ohad Cohen from the Institute of Endocrinology at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel.</p><p>The randomized, controlled OpT2mise study was sponsored by Medtronic and conducted with participation from 331 patients, ranging in age from 30 to 75 years.

This improvement in glucose control was achieved without any episodes of severe hypoglycemia. In addition, those in the insulin pump group lowered the total daily dose of insulin by more than 20 percent. Participants in this group were taken off all glucose-lowering medications, with the exception of metformin, prior to the study. There was no difference in weight gain between the two groups.</p><p>Approximately 20 million people around the world with type 2 diabetes require insulin replacement therapy.

The finding, which is published in the journal <em>Diabetes</em>, provides a new molecular mechanism underlying age-related impairment of insulin-producing cells and diabetes.</p><p>Ageing is among the largest known risk factors for many diseases, and type 2 diabetes is no exception. People older than 65 years have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their insulin-producing cells in the pancreas fail to compensate for insulin resistance. A decline in insulin secretion from these so called beta cells is considered to be a major contributing factor to disease development, but little has been known about why this happens.</p><p>As the investigators behind the recent study searched for a link between ageing, beta cell dysfunction and diabetes, they took a closer look at calcium ions.</p><p>\"Calcium ions as mediators of signals in the cell play a crucial role in regulating the function and survival of insulin-producing beta cells\", says Luo-Sheng Li, at The Rolf Luft Research Center for Diabetes and Endocrinology at Karolinska Institutet, the study\\'s first author.</p><p>The researchers studied three different types of mice that differ in age-induced deterioration.

When comparing the mice, the investigators found that the function of the mitochondria is reduced with age.

Stanford University researchers have recently uncovered one of these \"pathways\" into the cell by piecing together proteins slightly wider than the diameter of a strand of spider silk.</p><p>To determine the size, shape and orientation of one of the newest (and smallest) of these proteins, the sugar transporter, researchers turned to the North Eastern Collaborative Access Team\\'s (NE-CAT) and the General Medical Sciences and Cancer Institute\\'s Structural Biology (GM/CA) Facility research facilities at the Advanced Photon Source at the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Argonne National Laboratory.</p><p>These transporters, called SWEETs, are proteins that act as pathways for sugar molecules to cross the cell membrane, where they can be used as energy to power the cell. They exist in everything from bacteria to plants to animals, though their functionality may differ for each.</p><p>The sugar you sprinkle on your breakfast cereal in the morning would never fit through one of these pathways. The sugars moving through SWEETs are the size of a molecule, invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>Like a canal\\'s gate and lock system for boats, SWEETs allow sugar molecules to enter this pathway, closing one gate and opening another, in three different stages.</p><p>\"This is the first time we were able to view the transporter\\'s structure and begin to understand the mechanism by which it functions,\" said Stanford University researcher Liang Feng. \"The machinery changes shape dramatically in order for molecules to move between the outside and the inside of the cell.\"</p><p>Previous research indicated that SWEETs transport sugar molecules, but until now, researchers did not know how the transporter did its job. To discover this, they had to piece the structure together, atom by atom.</p><p>Beamlines at the NE-CAT and GM/CA, both housed at the APS, use high-powered X-rays to determine the three dimensional structure of complex biological structures, from DNA to viruses to proteins at the nanoscale.

Working in concert with the APS, NE-CAT and GM/CA accept high intensity X-rays generated by these magnets and focus them through a series of mirrors into a micro-beam. Specialized equipment on these beamlines allow scientists to examine very small micrometer-sized samples, like those grown by Feng\\'s lab.</p><p>\"The APS has one of the brightest beams in the world, making it able to create extremely high-resolution images,\" said Perry. \"It worked out really well because Liang wants to see the individual bonds between atoms, and we were able to do that for him.\"</p><p>In collaboration with Wolf Frommer, director of Carnegie Institution for Science\\'s Plant Biology Department, Feng\\'s group has successfully captured SWEETs in two different shapes.

       " 'Final pieces to the circadian clock puzzle found\\n <p>Sixteen years after scientists found the genes that control the circadian clock in all cells, the lab of UNC\\'s Aziz Sancar, M.D., Ph.D., discovered the mechanisms responsible for keeping the clock in synch. Researchers at the UNC School of Medicine have discovered how two genes - Period and Cryptochrome - keep the circadian clocks in all human cells in time and in proper rhythm with the 24-hour day, as well as the seasons. The finding, published in the journal <em>Genes and Development</em>, has implications for the development of drugs for various diseases such as cancers and diabetes, as well as conditions such as metabolic syndrome, insomnia, seasonal affective disorder, obesity, and even jetlag.</p><p>\"Discovering how these circadian clock genes interact has been a long-time coming,\" said Aziz Sancar, MD, PhD, Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics and senior author of the Genes and Development paper. \"We\\'ve known for a while that four proteins were involved in generating daily rhythmicity but not exactly what they did. Now we know how the clock is reset in all cells. So we have a better idea of what to expect if we target these proteins with therapeutics.\"</p><p>In all human cells, there are four genes - Cryptochrome, Period, CLOCK, and BMAL1 - that work in unison to control the cyclical changes in human physiology, such as blood pressure, body temperature, and rest-sleep cycles. The way in which these genes control physiology helps prepare us for the day. This is called the circadian clock. It keeps us in proper physiological rhythm. When we try to fast-forward or rewind the natural 24-hour day, such as when we fly seven time zones away, our circadian clocks don\\'t let us off easy; the genes and proteins need time to adjust. Jetlag is the feeling of our cells \"realigning\" to their new environment and the new starting point of a solar day.</p><p>Previously, scientists found that CLOCK and BMAL1 work in tandem to kick start the circadian clock. These genes bind to many other genes and turn them on to express proteins. This allows cells, such as brain cells, to behave the way we need them to at the start of a day.</p><p>Specifically, CLOCK and BMAL1 bind to a pair of genes called Period and Cryptochrome and turn them on to express proteins, which - after several modifications - wind up suppressing CLOCK and BMAL1 activity. Then, the Period and Cryptochrome proteins are degraded, allowing for the circadian clock to begin again.</p><p>\"It\\'s a feedback loop,\" said Sancar, who discovered Cryptochrome in 1998. \"The inhibition takes 24 hours. This is why we can see gene activity go up and then down throughout the day.\"</p><p>But scientists didn\\'t know exactly how that gene suppression and protein degradation happened at the back end. In fact, during experiments using one compound to stifle Cryptochrome and another drug to hinder Period, other researchers found inconsistent effects on the circadian clock, suggesting that Cryptochrome and Period did not have the same role. Sancar, a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center who studies DNA repair in addition to the circadian clock, thought the two genes might have complementary roles. His team conducted experiments to find out.</p><p>Chris Selby, PhD, a research instructor in Sancar\\'s lab, used two different kinds of genetics techniques to create the first-ever cell line that lacked both Cryptochrome and Period. (Each cell has two versions of each gene. Selby knocked out all four copies.)</p><p>Then Rui Ye, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Sancar\\'s lab and first author of the Genes and Development paper, put Period back into the new mutant cells. But Period by itself did not inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1; it actually had no active function inside the cells.</p><p>Next, Ye put Cryptochrome alone back into the cell line. He found that Cryptochrome not only suppressed CLOCK and BMAL1, but it squashed them indefinitely.</p><p>\"The Cryptochrome just sat there,\" Sancar said. \"It wasn\\'t degraded. The circadian clock couldn\\'t restart.\"</p><p>For the final experiment, Sancar\\'s team added Period to the cells with Cryptochrome. As Period\\'s protein accumulated inside cells, the scientists could see that it began to remove the Cryptochrome, as well as CLOCK and BMAL1. This led to the eventual degradation of Cryptochrome, and then the CLOCK-BMAL1 genes were free to restart the circadian clock anew to complete the 24-hour cycle.</p><p>\"What we\\'ve done is show how the entire clock really works,\" Sancar said. \"Now, when we screen for drugs that target these proteins, we know to expect different outcomes and why we get those outcomes. Whether it\\'s for treatment of jetlag or seasonal affective disorder or for controlling and optimizing cancer treatments, we had to know exactly how this clock worked.\"</p><p>Previous to this research, in 2010, Sancar\\'s lab found that the level of an enzyme called XPA increased and decreased in synchrony with the circadian clock\\'s natural oscillations throughout the day. Sancar\\'s team proposed that chemotherapy would be most effective when XPA is at its lowest level. For humans, that\\'s late in the afternoon.</p><p>\"This means that DNA repair is controlled by the circadian clock,\" Sancar said. \"It also means that the circadian clocks in cancer cells could become targets for cancer drugs in order to make other therapeutics more effective.\"</p> \\nSixteen years after scientists found the genes that control the circadian clock in all cells, the lab of UNC\\'s Aziz Sancar, M.D., Ph.D.\\n']"
